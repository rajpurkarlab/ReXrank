Impression: 1. Standard positions of the endotracheal and orogastric tubes.\n2. Focal, somewhat linear opacities within both upper lobes which may be due to a chronic interstitial process.\nCorrelation with prior imaging is recommended.\nAspiration or infection, however, cannot be completely excluded.\n3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion in the setting of low lung volumes."

Impression: 1. Increasing bibasilar opacities which could be seen with lower airway inflammation or infection, although developing bronchopneumonia is not entirely excluded.\n2. Mild anterior wedge compression deformity of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction, likely L1; although probably chronic, potentially increased somewhat."

Diffusely increased osseous density.\nThere is an extensive differential, which should be correlated with the clinical presentation.\nThe differential includes changes due to osteodystrophy.\nIn the appropriate clinical setting, osteosclerosis could have a similar appearance."
