The design usually consists of drawings and specifications, usually prepared by a design team including Architect, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, structural engineers, fire protection engineers, planning consultants, architectural consultants, and archaeological consultants. The design team is most commonly employed by (i.e. in contract with) the property owner. Under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work, either based directly on the design, or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor. Following evaluation of bids, the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572745c6708984140094db9a"><p> <strong class="question">A formal design team may be assembled to do what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts</span><span class="answer">plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts</span><span class="answer">plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572745c6708984140094db99"><p> <strong class="question">Construction involves the translation of what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">designs into reality</span><span class="answer">designs into reality</span><span class="answer">designs into reality</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572745c6708984140094db9b"><p> <strong class="question">The design team is most commonly employed by who?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the property owner</span><span class="answer">the property owner</span><span class="answer">property owner</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572745c6708984140094db9c"><p> <strong class="question">Who provides the bill of quantities?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a quantity surveyor</span><span class="answer">quantity surveyor</span><span class="answer">quantity surveyor</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572745c6708984140094db9d"><p> <strong class="question">The owner typically awards a contract to who?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the most cost efficient bidder</span><span class="answer">the most cost efficient bidder</span><span class="answer">most cost efficient bidder</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties, especially among large firms.

This is in contrast to a design-bid-build contract, where the project is completely designed by the owner, then bid on, then completed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57275411dd62a815002e9b30"><p> <strong class="question">Who produces a list of requirements for a project, giving an overall view of the project's goals?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The owner</span><span class="answer">The owner</span><span class="answer">The owner</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57275411dd62a815002e9b31"><p> <strong class="question">Who presents different ideas about how to accomplish goals?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">D&amp;B contractors</span><span class="answer">D&amp;B contractors</span><span class="answer">Several D&amp;B contractors</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57275411dd62a815002e9b32"><p> <strong class="question">Who selects and hires the best ideas and appropriate contractors?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The owner</span><span class="answer">The owner</span><span class="answer">The owner</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57275411dd62a815002e9b33"><p> <strong class="question">Who is usually working together?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a consortium of several contractors</span><span class="answer">a consortium of several contractors</span><span class="answer">a consortium of several contractors</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57275411dd62a815002e9b34"><p> <strong class="question">What happens as they build phase 1?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">they design phase 2</span><span class="answer">they design phase 2</span><span class="answer">they design phase 2</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Before the foundation can be dug, contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked, either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services. This lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities, which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations. During the construction of a building, the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code. Once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed, an occupancy permit may be issued.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572754fff1498d1400e8f660"><p> <strong class="question">Who is required to verify and have existing utility lines marked?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">contractors</span><span class="answer">contractors</span><span class="answer">contractors</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572754fff1498d1400e8f661"><p> <strong class="question">Having existing utility lines marked lessens the likelihood of what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">damage</span><span class="answer">the likelihood of damage</span><span class="answer">the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572754fff1498d1400e8f662"><p> <strong class="question">What are some existing facilities?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities</span><span class="answer">electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable</span><span class="answer">electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572754fff1498d1400e8f663"><p> <strong class="question">Who inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the municipal building inspector</span><span class="answer">municipal building inspector</span><span class="answer">the municipal building inspector</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572754fff1498d1400e8f664"><p> <strong class="question">What is issued once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">an occupancy permit</span><span class="answer">occupancy permit</span><span class="answer">an occupancy permit</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the United States, the industry in 2014 has around $960 billion in annual revenue according to statistics tracked by the Census Bureau, of which $680 billion is private (split evenly between residential and nonresidential) and the remainder is government.

The results showed that areas of particularly strong growth in the construction industry, such as the Middle East, yield higher average salaries than in the UK for example. The average earning for a professional in the construction industry in the Middle East, across all sectors, job types and levels of experience, is £42,090, compared to £26,719 in the UK. This trend is not necessarily due to the fact that more affluent roles are available, however, as architects with 14 or more years experience working in the Middle East earn on average £43,389 per annum, compared to £40,000 in the UK. Some construction workers in the US/Canada have made more than $100,000 annually, depending on their trade.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727565ef1498d1400e8f674"><p> <strong class="question">What is the average construction salary in the Middle East?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">£42,090</span><span class="answer">£42,090</span><span class="answer">£42,090</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727565ef1498d1400e8f675"><p> <strong class="question">What is the average construction salary in the UK?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">£26,719</span><span class="answer">£26,719</span><span class="answer">£26,719</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727565ef1498d1400e8f676"><p> <strong class="question">Where have some workers made more than $100,000?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">US/Canada</span><span class="answer">US/Canada</span><span class="answer">US/Canada</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United States and in the European Union.

Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers. Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry.
