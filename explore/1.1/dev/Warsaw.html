Though Chopin was born in the village of Żelazowa Wola, about 60 km (37 mi) from Warsaw, he moved to the city with his family when he was seven months old. Casimir Pulaski, a Polish general and hero of the American Revolutionary War, was born here in 1745.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733a5f54776f41900660f45"><p> <strong class="question">What was Maria Curie the first female recipient of?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Nobel Prize</span><span class="answer">Nobel Prize</span><span class="answer">Nobel Prize</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733a5f54776f41900660f48"><p> <strong class="question">What year was Casimir Pulaski born in Warsaw?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1745</span><span class="answer">1745</span><span class="answer">1745</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733a5f54776f41900660f44"><p> <strong class="question">Who was one of the most famous people born in Warsaw?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Maria Skłodowska-Curie</span><span class="answer">Maria Skłodowska-Curie</span><span class="answer">Maria Skłodowska-Curie</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733a5f54776f41900660f46"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Frédéric Chopin?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Famous musicians</span><span class="answer">musicians</span><span class="answer">Famous musicians</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733a5f54776f41900660f47"><p> <strong class="question">How old was Chopin when he moved to Warsaw with his family?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">seven months old</span><span class="answer">seven months old</span><span class="answer">seven months old</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Saxon Garden, covering the area of 15.5 ha, was formally a royal garden. There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax. At the east end of the park, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated. In the 19th century the Krasiński Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: maidenhair tree, black walnut, Turkish hazel and Caucasian wingnut trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasiński Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. The Łazienki Park covers the area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carps in the pond. The Wilanów Palace Park, dates back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers the area of 43 ha. Its central French-styled area corresponds to the ancient, baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond. The park around the Królikarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula. The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57336755d058e614000b5a3d"><p> <strong class="question">Over how many species of trees can be found in the Saxon Garden?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">100</span><span class="answer">over 100</span><span class="answer">100</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57336755d058e614000b5a3f"><p> <strong class="question">What is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Krasiński Palace Garden</span><span class="answer">Krasiński Palace Garden</span><span class="answer">Krasiński Palace Garden</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57336755d058e614000b5a3c"><p> <strong class="question">What garden was formally only for royalty?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Saxon Garden</span><span class="answer">Saxon Garden</span><span class="answer">The Saxon Garden</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57336755d058e614000b5a3e"><p> <strong class="question">Which end of the Saxon Garden is the Tom of the Unknown Soldier located at?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">east end</span><span class="answer">east</span><span class="answer">east</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57336755d058e614000b5a40"><p> <strong class="question">What park covers an area of 76 ha.?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Łazienki</span><span class="answer">Łazienki Park</span><span class="answer">Łazienki Park</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There are 13 natural reserves in Warsaw – among others, Bielany Forest, Kabaty Woods, Czerniaków Lake.

Warsaw's prewar Jewish population of more than 350,000 constituted about 30 percent of the city's total population. In 1933, out of 1,178,914 inhabitants 833,500 were of Polish mother tongue. World War II changed the demographics of the city, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of Warsaw's history.

Gatherings of thousands of people on the banks of the Vistula on Midsummer’s Night for a festival called Wianki (Polish for Wreaths) have become a tradition and a yearly event in the programme of cultural events in Warsaw. The festival traces its roots to a peaceful pagan ritual where maidens would float their wreaths of herbs on the water to predict when they would be married, and to whom. By the 19th century this tradition had become a festive event, and it continues today. The city council organize concerts and other events. Each Midsummer’s Eve, apart from the official floating of wreaths, jumping over fires, looking for the fern flower, there are musical performances, dignitaries' speeches, fairs and fireworks by the river bank.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57339dd94776f41900660ecc"><p> <strong class="question">What is the polish word for wreaths?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Wianki</span><span class="answer">Wianki</span><span class="answer">Wianki</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57339dd94776f41900660ecd"><p> <strong class="question">How man people gather along the banks of the Vistula for the Wianki festival?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">thousands</span><span class="answer">thousands</span><span class="answer">thousands</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57339dd94776f41900660ece"><p> <strong class="question">When is the Wianki festival held?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Midsummer’s Night</span><span class="answer">Midsummer’s Night</span><span class="answer">Midsummer’s Night</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57339dd94776f41900660ecf"><p> <strong class="question">What will maidens be able to predict by floating their wreaths down the Vistula?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">when they would be married</span><span class="answer">when they would be married, and to whom</span><span class="answer">when they would be married,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57339dd94776f41900660ed0"><p> <strong class="question">What type of flower is sought on Midsummer's Eve?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the fern</span><span class="answer">fern</span><span class="answer">fern</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As interesting examples of expositions the most notable are: the world's first Museum of Posters boasting one of the largest collections of art posters in the world, Museum of Hunting and Riding and the Railway Museum.

The second mermaid reached the mouth of the Vistula River and plunged into its waters.

After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte. In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the &quot;Congress Kingdom&quot;. Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. Warsaw gained the title of the &quot;Phoenix City&quot; because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings. On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733140a4776f419006606e0"><p> <strong class="question">When is the first reference in history to Warsaw?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1313</span><span class="answer">1313</span><span class="answer">1313</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733140a4776f419006606e1"><p> <strong class="question">What city served as Poland's capital in 1313?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Kraków</span><span class="answer">Kraków</span><span class="answer">Kraków</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733140a4776f419006606e2"><p> <strong class="question">When did Warsaw become the capital of the Kingdom of Poland?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1596</span><span class="answer">1596</span><span class="answer">1596</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733140a4776f419006606e3"><p> <strong class="question">Who moved his court from Kraków to Warsaw in 1596?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">King Sigismund III Vasa</span><span class="answer">King Sigismund III Vasa</span><span class="answer">King Sigismund III Vasa</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733140a4776f419006606e4"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Warsaw gain the title of the &quot;Phoenix City&quot;?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">survived many wars, conflicts and invasions</span><span class="answer">it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions</span><span class="answer">because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The city is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese (left bank of the Vistula) and diocese (right bank), and possesses various universities, most notably the Polish Academy of Sciences and the University of Warsaw, two opera houses, theatres, museums, libraries and monuments.

Three times between 1655–1658 the city was under siege and three times it was taken and pillaged by the Swedish, Brandenburgian and Transylvanian forces.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733266d4776f41900660712"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Warsaw serve as the seat for in 1529?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">General Sejm</span><span class="answer">General Sejm</span><span class="answer">General Sejm</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733266d4776f41900660713"><p> <strong class="question">When did the General Sejm make Warsaw it's permanent seat?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1569</span><span class="answer">1569</span><span class="answer">1569</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733266d4776f41900660714"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Warsaw Confederation formally establish in 1573?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">religious freedom</span><span class="answer">religious freedom in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</span><span class="answer">religious freedom</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733266d4776f41900660715"><p> <strong class="question">Why did Warsaw become the capital of the Commonwealth?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Due to its central location</span><span class="answer">its central location</span><span class="answer">central location</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733266d4776f41900660716"><p> <strong class="question">What year did King Sigismund III Vasa move his court to Warsaw?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1596</span><span class="answer">1596</span><span class="answer">1596</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Warsaw remained the capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1796, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia to become the capital of the province of South Prussia.

The city would become the centre of urban resistance to Nazi rule in occupied Europe. When the order came to annihilate the ghetto as part of Hitler's &quot;Final Solution&quot; on 19 April 1943, Jewish fighters launched the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.

Thus, on 1 August 1944, as the Red Army was nearing the city, the Warsaw Uprising began. The armed struggle, planned to last 48 hours, was partially successful, however it went on for 63 days. Eventually the Home Army fighters and civilians assisting them were forced to capitulate. They were transported to PoW camps in Germany, while the entire civilian population was expelled.

Warsaw has also two botanic gardens: by the Łazienki park (a didactic-research unit of the University of Warsaw) as well as by the Park of Culture and Rest in Powsin (a unit of the Polish Academy of Science).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573368e54776f41900660a53"><p> <strong class="question">Why is Warsaw's flora very rich in species?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">location of Warsaw</span><span class="answer">location of Warsaw</span><span class="answer">location</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573368e54776f41900660a54"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Bielany Forest located?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">within the borders of Warsaw</span><span class="answer">Warsaw</span><span class="answer">within the borders of Warsaw</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573368e54776f41900660a55"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Bielany Forest the last remnant of?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Masovian Primeval Forest</span><span class="answer">Masovian Primeval Forest</span><span class="answer">Masovian Primeval Forest</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573368e54776f41900660a56"><p> <strong class="question">What forest is by Warsaw's southern border?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Kabaty</span><span class="answer">Kabaty Forest</span><span class="answer">Kabaty</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573368e54776f41900660a57"><p> <strong class="question">How many botanical gardens does Warsaw have?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">two</span><span class="answer">two</span><span class="answer">two</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1939, c. 1,300,000 people lived in Warsaw, but in 1945 – only 420,000. During the first years after the war, the population growth was c. 6%, so shortly the city started to suffer from the lack of flats and of areas for new houses. The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement (1951) – but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the population growth in the following years. It also bolstered some kind of conviction among Poles that Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital. Unfortunately this belief still lives on in Poland (although not as much as it used to be) – even though since 1990 there are no limitations to residency registration anymore.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57337f6ad058e614000b5bcb"><p> <strong class="question">How many people lived in Warsaw in 1939?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1,300,000</span><span class="answer">1,300,000</span><span class="answer">1,300,000</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57337f6ad058e614000b5bcc"><p> <strong class="question">What had the number of people living in Warsaw declined to by 1945?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">420,000</span><span class="answer">420,000</span><span class="answer">420,000</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57337f6ad058e614000b5bcd"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Warsaw area enlargement take place?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1951</span><span class="answer">1951</span><span class="answer">1951</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57337f6ad058e614000b5bce"><p> <strong class="question">What conviction did many Poles have regarding how the Varsovians thought of themselves?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">as better</span><span class="answer">thought of themselves as better</span><span class="answer">better</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57337f6ad058e614000b5bcf"><p> <strong class="question">What are there no longer limitations on since 1990?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">residency registration</span><span class="answer">residency registration</span><span class="answer">residency registration</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Throughout its existence, Warsaw has been a multi-cultural city.

Eight years later, in 1909, there were 281,754 Jews (36.9%), 18,189 Protestants (2.4%) and 2,818 Mariavites (0.4%). This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town. Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.

A city is also a commune – but with the city charter. Both cities and communes are governed by a mayor – but in the communes the mayor is vogt (wójt in Polish), however in the cities – burmistrz. Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e. tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division – counties or powiats. An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a gmina cannot register cars, this is a powiat's task (i.e. a registration number depends on what powiat a car had been registered, not gmina). In this case we say about city county or powiat grodzki. Such cities are for example Lublin, Kraków, Gdańsk, Poznań. In Warsaw, its districts additionally have some of powiat's entitlements – like already mentioned car registration. For example, the district Wola has its own evidence and the district Ursynów – its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than these from Ursynów). But for instance the districts in Kraków do not have entitlements of powiat, so the registration numbers in Kraków are of the same type for all districts.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573380e0d058e614000b5be9"><p> <strong class="question">What is the basic unit of territorial division in Poland?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a commune</span><span class="answer">commune</span><span class="answer">commune</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573380e0d058e614000b5bea"><p> <strong class="question">What is the second level of territorial division in Poland?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">counties or powiats</span><span class="answer">counties or powiats</span><span class="answer">counties or powiats</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573380e0d058e614000b5beb"><p> <strong class="question">In what districts are the registration numbers for cars all of the same type?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Kraków</span><span class="answer">Kraków</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Legislative power in Warsaw is vested in a unicameral Warsaw City Council (Rada Miasta), which comprises 60 members.
