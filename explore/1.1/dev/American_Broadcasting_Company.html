Noble. It extended its operations to television in 1948, following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks CBS and NBC. In the mid-1950s, ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres, a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. Leonard Goldenson, who had been the head of UPT, made the new television network profitable by helping develop and greenlight many successful series. In the 1980s, after purchasing an 80% interest in cable sports channel ESPN, the network's parent merged with Capital Cities Communications, owner of several print publications, and television and radio stations. In 1996, most of Capital Cities/ABC's assets were purchased by The Walt Disney Company.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57267ca75951b619008f7469"><p> <strong class="question">When did ABC first start?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">October 12, 1943</span><span class="answer">October 12, 1943</span><span class="answer">October 12, 1943</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57267ca75951b619008f746a"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of network was ABC when it first began?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">radio network</span><span class="answer">radio</span><span class="answer">radio network</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57267ca75951b619008f746b"><p> <strong class="question">When did ABC first get in to television broadcasts?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1948</span><span class="answer">1948</span><span class="answer">1948</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57267ca75951b619008f746c"><p> <strong class="question">In the 1980s, what cable sports channel did ABC purchase?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ESPN</span><span class="answer">ESPN</span><span class="answer">ESPN</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57267ca75951b619008f746d"><p> <strong class="question">What company did the ABC network's parent company merge with in the 1980s?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Capital Cities Communications</span><span class="answer">Capital Cities Communications</span><span class="answer">Capital Cities Communications</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The television network has eight owned-and-operated and over 232 affiliated television stations throughout the United States and its territories.

In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the practices of radio networks and published its report on the broadcasting of network radio programs in 1940. The report recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue. At that time, the NBC Red Network was the principal radio network in the United States and, according to the FCC, RCA was using NBC Blue to eliminate any hint of competition. Having no power over the networks themselves, the FCC established a regulation forbidding licenses to be issued for radio stations if they were affiliated with a network which already owned multiple networks that provided content of public interest.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572681ab708984140094c85d"><p> <strong class="question">What company filed a complaint with the FCC in 1934 concerning problems establishing new stations?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Mutual</span><span class="answer">Mutual</span><span class="answer">Mutual filed</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572681ab708984140094c85e"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the FCC begin an investigation in to the operation of radio networks in America</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1938</span><span class="answer">1938</span><span class="answer">1938</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572681ab708984140094c85f"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the FCC publish it's report?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1940</span><span class="answer">1940</span><span class="answer">1940</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572681ab708984140094c860"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main radio network in the 1940s in America?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">NBC Red Network</span><span class="answer">NBC Red Network</span><span class="answer">NBC Red Network</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572681ab708984140094c861"><p> <strong class="question">What radio network was RCA using to eliminate competition in 1940?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">NBC Blue</span><span class="answer">NBC Blue</span><span class="answer">NBC Blue</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Once Mutual's appeals against the FCC were rejected, RCA decided to sell NBC Blue in 1941, and gave the mandate to do so to Mark Woods.

The newly separated NBC Red and NBC Blue divided their respective corporate assets. Between 1942 and 1943, Woods offered to sell the entire NBC Blue Network, a package that included leases on landlines, three pending television licenses (WJZ-TV in New York City, KGO-TV in San Francisco and WENR-TV in Chicago), 60 affiliates, four operations facilities (in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington D.C.), contracts with actors, and the brand associated with the Blue Network.

The network also became known for such suspenseful dramas as Sherlock Holmes, Gang Busters and Counterspy, as well as several mid-afternoon youth-oriented programs. However, ABC made a name for itself by utilizing the practice of counterprogramming, with which it often placed shows of its own against the offerings of NBC and CBS, adopting the use of the Magnetophon tape recorder, brought to the U.S. from Nazi Germany after its conquest, to pre-record its programming. With the help of the Magnetophon, ABC was able to provide its stars with greater freedom in terms of time, and also attract several big names, such as Bing Crosby at a time when NBC and CBS did not allow pre-taped shows.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57268739708984140094c8ed"><p> <strong class="question">What new technology allowed ABC to pre-record its shows?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Magnetophon tape recorder</span><span class="answer">Magnetophon</span><span class="answer">Magnetophon tape recorder</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57268739708984140094c8ee"><p> <strong class="question">ABC aired symphony performances by what conductor?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Paul Whiteman</span><span class="answer">Paul Whiteman</span><span class="answer">Paul Whiteman</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57268739708984140094c8ef"><p> <strong class="question">What network was known for dramas such as Sherlock Holmes?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ABC</span><span class="answer">ABC</span><span class="answer">NBC Blue</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57268739708984140094c8f0"><p> <strong class="question">Who was a big star that ABC was able to attract because of Magnetophon technology?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Bing Crosby</span><span class="answer">Bing Crosby</span><span class="answer">Bing Crosby</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57268739708984140094c8f1"><p> <strong class="question">ABC continued NBC Blue's tradition of what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">public service</span><span class="answer">public service</span><span class="answer">public service</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A second period of international expansion is linked to that of the ESPN network in the 1990s, and policies enacted in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks (which included the expansion of several of the company's U.S.-based cable networks including Disney Channel and its spinoffs Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney and Jetix; although Disney also sold its 33% stake in European sports channel Eurosport for $155 million in June 2000). In contrast to Disney's other channels, ABC is broadcast in the United States, although the network's programming is syndicated in many countries. The policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived in 2004 when on September 27 of that year, ABC announced the launch of ABC1, a free-to-air channel in the United Kingdom owned by the ABC Group. However, on September 8, 2007, Disney announced that it would discontinue ABC1 citing to the channel's inability to attain sustainable viewership. With ABC1's shutdown that October, the company's attempt to develop ABC International were discontinued.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269260dd62a815002e89ea"><p> <strong class="question">How much did Disney sell it's stake in Eurosport for in 2000?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">$155 million</span><span class="answer">$155 million</span><span class="answer">$155 million</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269260dd62a815002e89eb"><p> <strong class="question">What network was launched by ABC in 2004?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ABC1</span><span class="answer">ABC1</span><span class="answer">ABC1</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269260dd62a815002e89ec"><p> <strong class="question">When was ABC1 discontinued because of low viewership?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">September 8, 2007</span><span class="answer">September 8, 2007</span><span class="answer">September 8, 2007</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269260dd62a815002e89ed"><p> <strong class="question">What developmental network was discontinued after the shutdown of ABC1?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ABC International</span><span class="answer">ABC International</span><span class="answer">ABC International</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269260dd62a815002e89ee"><p> <strong class="question">What country is ABC broadcast in, in contrast to Disney's other channels?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">United States</span><span class="answer">United States</span><span class="answer">United States</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The idea was to create a network of wholly and partially owned channels, and affiliates to rebroadcast the network's programs. In 1959, this rerun activity was completed with program syndication, with ABC Films selling programs to networks not owned by ABC. The arrival of satellite television ended the need for ABC to hold interests in other countries; many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties. As a result, ABC was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks, mainly in Japan and Latin America, in the 1970s.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269344f1498d1400e8e43e"><p> <strong class="question">When did ABC Films begin selling programs to other networks?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1959</span><span class="answer">1959</span><span class="answer">1959</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269344f1498d1400e8e43f"><p> <strong class="question">What ended the need for ABC to maintain interests in other countries?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">satellite television</span><span class="answer">The arrival of satellite television</span><span class="answer">satellite television</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269344f1498d1400e8e440"><p> <strong class="question">Where were ABC's international networks mainly situated in the 1970s?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Japan and Latin America</span><span class="answer">Japan and Latin America</span><span class="answer">Japan and Latin America</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269344f1498d1400e8e441"><p> <strong class="question">Why was ABC forced to sell its interests in international networks in the 70s?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties</span><span class="answer">legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties</span><span class="answer">governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first attempts to internationalize the ABC television network date back to the 1950s, after Leonard Goldenson, following the United Paramount Theatres model, tried to use on ABC the same strategies he had made in expanding UPT's theater operation to the international market. Leonard Goldenson said that ABC's first international activity was broadcasting the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953; CBS and NBC were unable to cover the coronation live due to respective issues with technical problems and flight delays. NBC's plane landed in Latin America[where?], leading ABC to learn of subsidiaries in that region. Goldenson tried international investing, having ABC invest in the Latin American market, acquiring a 51% interest in a network covering Central America. Goldenson also cited interest in Japan in the early 1950s, acquiring a 5% stake in two new domestic networks, the Mainichi Broadcasting System in 1951 and Nihon Educational Television in 1957.

During the summer, ABC airs ESPN-produced highlight compilation programs for The Open Championship golf and The Wimbledon tennis tournaments to provide some presence for both events on American broadcast television.

Its revenues, which were related to advertising and were indexed compared to the number of listeners/viewers, failed to compensate for its heavy investments in purchasing and building stations. In 1951, a rumor even mentioned that the network would be sold to CBS.

Paley; however, a merger with CBS would have forced that network to sell its New York City and Los Angeles stations at the very least. Goldenson and Noble reached a tentative agreement in the late spring of 1951 in which UPT would acquire ABC and turn it into a subsidiary of the company that would retain autonomy in its management. On June 6, 1951, the tentative agreement was approved by UPT's board of directors. However, the transaction had to be approved by the FCC because of the presence of television networks and the recent separation between Paramount and UPT. Insofar as Paramount Pictures was already a shareholder in the DuMont Television Network, the FCC conducted a series of hearings to ensure whether Paramount was truly separated from United Paramount Theatres, and whether it was violating antitrust laws.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ec6ff1498d1400e8eff2"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the president of UPT in 1951?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Leonard Goldenson</span><span class="answer">Leonard Goldenson</span><span class="answer">Leonard Goldenson</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ec6ff1498d1400e8eff3"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the founder of CBS?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">William S.

One FCC Commissioner saw the possibility of ABC, funded by UPT, becoming a viable and competitive third television network. On February 9, 1953, the FCC approved UPT's purchase of ABC in exchange for $25 million in shares. The merged company, renamed American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. and headquartered in the Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway in Manhattan, owned six AM and several FM radio stations, five television stations and 644 cinemas in 300 U.S. cities. To comply with FCC ownership restrictions in effect at the time that barred common ownership of two television stations in the same market, UPT sold its Chicago television station, WBKB-TV, to CBS (which subsequently changed the station's call letters to WBBM-TV) for $6 million, while it kept ABC's existing Chicago station, WENR-TV. The merged company acquired the WBKB call letters for channel 7, which would eventually become WLS-TV. Goldenson began to sell some of the older theaters to help finance the new television network.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ed12708984140094d645"><p> <strong class="question">When was the FCC's sixth report and order released?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1952</span><span class="answer">1952</span><span class="answer">1952</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ed12708984140094d646"><p> <strong class="question">When did the FCC approve UPT's purchase of ABC?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">February 9, 1953</span><span class="answer">February 9, 1953</span><span class="answer">February 9, 1953</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ed12708984140094d647"><p> <strong class="question">When UPT bough ABC, what was the merged company called?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc</span><span class="answer">American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc.</span><span class="answer">American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ed12708984140094d648"><p> <strong class="question">Where was American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc headquartered after the merger?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Paramount Building</span><span class="answer">Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway in Manhattan</span><span class="answer">Paramount Building</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The network's flagship owned-and-operated station, WJZ-TV in New York City (later re-called WABC-TV), signed on the air on August 10, 1948, with its first broadcast running for two hours that evening.

A new four-note theme tune was introduced alongside the package, based around the network's &quot;We Love TV&quot; image campaign introduced that year, creating an audio signature on par with the NBC chimes, CBS' various three-note soundmarks (including the current version used since 2000) and the Fox Fanfare. The four-note signature has been updated with every television season thereafter (though variants of it used since the 1998–99 season remain in use during the production company vanity cards shown following the closing credits of most programs). In the fall of 2015, ABC is stopped with its 1998–2002 four-note jingles for promotions and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs over seventeen years, now it have a different and adventure-type music (with the drums of the network's four-note signature in the ending).

ABC ended the 2000–01 season as the most-watched network, ahead of NBC.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273abef1498d1400e8f4da"><p> <strong class="question">What cable company removed ABC stations from it's systems in certain markets in April 2000?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Time Warner Cable</span><span class="answer">Time Warner Cable</span><span class="answer">Time Warner Cable</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273abef1498d1400e8f4db"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the FCC rule in favor of in the April 2000 dispute between Time Warner Cable and ABC?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ABC</span><span class="answer">ABC</span><span class="answer">ABC</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273abef1498d1400e8f4dc"><p> <strong class="question">Which major network was the most watched for the 2000-01 season?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ABC</span><span class="answer">ABC</span><span class="answer">ABC</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273abef1498d1400e8f4dd"><p> <strong class="question">When was Time Warner cable forced to restore ABC stations to affected markets?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">afternoon of May 2.</span><span class="answer">afternoon of May 2</span><span class="answer">December 31, 1999</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In addition to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, the network entered the 2000s with hits held over from the previous decade such as The Practice, NYPD Blue and The Wonderful World of Disney and new series such as My Wife and Kids and According to Jim, all of which managed to help ABC stay ahead of the competition in the ratings in spite of the later departure of Millionaire. 2000 saw the end of &quot;TGIF&quot;, which was struggling to find new hits (with Boy Meets World and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, the latter of which moved to The WB in September 2000, beginning to wane as well by this point) following the loss of Family Matters and Step by Step to CBS as part of its own failed attempt at a family-oriented Friday comedy block in the 1997–98 season.

At its peak, the program aired as much as six nights a week. Buoyed by Millionaire, during the 1999–2000 season, ABC became the first network to move from third to first place in the ratings during a single television season. Millionaire ended its run on the network's primetime lineup after three years in 2002, with Buena Vista Television relaunching the show as a syndicated program (under that incarnation's original host Meredith Vieira) in September of that year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273c195951b619008f8721"><p> <strong class="question">When did ABC first premiere Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">August 1999</span><span class="answer">August 1999</span><span class="answer">August 1999</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273c195951b619008f8722"><p> <strong class="question">Who originally hosted Who Wants to Be a Millionaire for ABC?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Regis Philbin</span><span class="answer">Regis Philbin</span><span class="answer">Regis Philbin</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273c195951b619008f8723"><p> <strong class="question">What company relaunched Who Wants to Be a Millionaire as a syndicated program?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Buena Vista Television</span><span class="answer">Buena Vista Television</span><span class="answer">Buena Vista Television</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273c195951b619008f8724"><p> <strong class="question">Who originally hosted the syndicated version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Meredith Vieira</span><span class="answer">Meredith Vieira</span><span class="answer">Meredith Vieira</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On July 31, 1995, The Walt Disney Company announced an agreement to merge with Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion. Disney shareholders approved the merger at a special conference in New York City on January 4, 1996, with the acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC being completed on February 9; following the sale, Disney renamed its new subsidiary ABC Inc. In addition to the ABC network, the Disney acquisition integrated ABC's ten owned-and-operated television and 21 radio stations; its 80% interest in ESPN, ownership interests in The History Channel, A&amp;E Television Networks, and Lifetime Entertainment; and Capital Cities/ABC's magazine and newspaper properties into the company. As FCC ownership rules forbade the company from keeping both it and KABC-TV, Disney sold Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV to Young Broadcasting for $387 million. On April 4, Disney sold the four newspapers that ABC had controlled under Capital Cities to Knight Ridder for $1.65 billion. Following the merger, Thomas S. Murphy left ABC with Robert Iger taking his place as president and CEO. Around the time of the merger, Disney's television production units had already produced series for the network such as Home Improvement and Boy Meets World, while the deal also allowed ABC access to Disney's children's programming library for its Saturday morning block. In 1998, ABC premiered the Aaron Sorkin-created sitcom Sports Night, centering on the travails of the staff of a SportsCenter-style sports news program; despite earning critical praise and multiple Emmy Awards, the series was cancelled in 2000 after two seasons.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273d19708984140094db3d"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Disney and ABC merger first announced?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">July 31, 1995</span><span class="answer">July 31, 1995</span><span class="answer">On July 31, 1995</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273d19708984140094db3e"><p> <strong class="question">What did Disney rename Capital City/ABC after first acquiring the company?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ABC Inc.</span><span class="answer">ABC Inc.</span><span class="answer">ABC Inc</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273d19708984140094db3f"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Disney sell the four newspapers that ABC controlled to?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Knight Ridder</span><span class="answer">Knight Ridder</span><span class="answer">Knight Ridder</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273d19708984140094db40"><p> <strong class="question">Who took Thomas Murphy's place after the Disney acquisition of ABC?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Robert Iger</span><span class="answer">Robert Iger</span><span class="answer">Robert Iger</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57273d19708984140094db41"><p> <strong class="question">What Aaron Sorkin created show did ABC debut in 1998?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Sports Night</span><span class="answer">Sports Night</span><span class="answer">Sports Night</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>It was not until the 1965–66 season that color became the dominant format for the three broadcast television networks.

Despite the promise of non-interference between ABC and UPT, Goldenson had to intervene in ABC's decisions because of financial problems and the FCC's long period of indecision. Goldenson added to the confusion when, in October 1954, he proposed a merger between UPT and the DuMont Television Network, which was also mired in financial trouble. As part of this merger, the network would have been renamed &quot;ABC-DuMont&quot; for five years, and DuMont would have received $5 million in cash, room on the schedule for existing DuMont programming, and guaranteed advertising time for DuMont Laboratories receivers. In addition, to comply with FCC ownership restrictions, it would have been required to sell either WABC-TV or DuMont owned-and-operated station WABD in the New York City market, as well as two other stations.

Around 1954, ABC agreed to finance Disneyland in exchange for the right to broadcast a new Sunday night program, Disneyland, which debuted on the network on October 27, 1954 as the first of many anthology television programs that Disney would broadcast over the course of the next 50 years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572741aaf1498d1400e8f53e"><p> <strong class="question">What was Walt Disney's brother's name?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Roy</span><span class="answer">Roy</span><span class="answer">Roy</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572741aaf1498d1400e8f53f"><p> <strong class="question">How much did Walt Disney want ABC to invest in Disneyland?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">$500,000</span><span class="answer">$500,000</span><span class="answer">$500,000</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572741aaf1498d1400e8f540"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did ABC agree to finance Disneyland?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1954</span><span class="answer">1954</span><span class="answer">1954</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572741aaf1498d1400e8f541"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first Disney program televised on ABC as a result of the Disney-ABC agreement?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Disneyland</span><span class="answer">Disneyland</span><span class="answer">Disneyland</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In July 1968, ABC Radio launched a special programming project for its FM stations, which was spearheaded by Allen Shaw, a former program manager at WCFL in Chicago who was approached by ABC Radio president Harold L.

The new concept called &quot;LOVE Radio&quot;, which featured a limited selection of music genres, was launched on ABC's seven owned-and-operated FM stations in late November 1968; the concept replaced nearly all of the programming provided by these stations; however, several affiliates (such as KXYZ) retained the majority of their content. In August 1970, Shaw announced that ABC FM's music choice policy should be reviewed to allow listeners access to many styles of music.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572742daf1498d1400e8f550"><p> <strong class="question">Who lead the 1968 special programming for ABC Radio's FM stations?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Allen Shaw</span><span class="answer">Allen Shaw</span><span class="answer">Allen Shaw</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572742daf1498d1400e8f551"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the ABC Radio president in 1968?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Harold L.

In 1974, ABC premiered the detective series S.W.A.T. That same year, the network made the decision to compete with NBC's morning news-talk program Today. Its first attempt at such competition was AM America; however, that show's success was not straightforward. One of its affiliates, WCVB-TV premiered morning show Good Day!. First premiering in 1973 as Good Morning!, it was groundbreaking for being entirely produced on the road and broadcasting from locations outside of the Boston area. Also, in the summer of 1975, ABC discovered that its Cleveland affiliate WEWS-TV was producing its own morning program The Morning Exchange, which debuted in 1972 and was now locally pre-empting AM America; it was the first morning show to utilize a set modeled after a living room, and established a concept now commonplace among network morning shows in which news and weather updates were featured at the top and bottom of each hour. Discovering that their formats seemed to appeal to their viewers, the network became the first to adopt them for a new national morning show, Good Morning America, which debuted on November 3, 1975.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572748745951b619008f87b1"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the President of ABC television in 1976?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Fred Pierce</span><span class="answer">Fred Pierce</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572748745951b619008f87b2"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first president and director of programming for ABC Entertainment?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Fred Silverman</span><span class="answer">Fred Silverman</span><span class="answer">Fred Silverman</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572748745951b619008f87b3"><p> <strong class="question">In 1974, what detective series debuted on ABC?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">S.W.A.T</span><span class="answer">S.W.A.T.</span><span class="answer">S.W.A.T</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572748745951b619008f87b4"><p> <strong class="question">When did Good Morning America first debut?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">November 3, 1975</span><span class="answer">November 3, 1975</span><span class="answer">1973</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The 1970s were highlighted by several successful comedy, fantasy, action and superhero-themed series for the network including Kung Fu, The Six Million Dollar Man, Wonder Woman, Starsky &amp; Hutch, Charlie's Angels, The Bionic Woman, Fantasy Island and Battlestar Galactica.

On September 13, 1977, the network debuted Soap, a controversial soap opera parody which became known for being the first television series to feature an openly gay main character (played by a then-unknown Billy Crystal); it last ran on the network on April 20, 1981.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572749d7dd62a815002e9a90"><p> <strong class="question">The Roots miniseries was based on a novel by what author?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Alex Haley</span><span class="answer">Alex Haley</span><span class="answer">Alex Haley</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572749d7dd62a815002e9a91"><p> <strong class="question">Who produced the comedy-drama The Love Boat?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Aaron Spelling</span><span class="answer">Aaron Spelling</span><span class="answer">Aaron Spelling</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572749d7dd62a815002e9a92"><p> <strong class="question">How many seasons did The Love Boat run for?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">nine seasons</span><span class="answer">nine</span><span class="answer">nine</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572749d7dd62a815002e9a93"><p> <strong class="question">During which season did ABC first take the lead spot in television rating?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1976–77 season</span><span class="answer">1976–77</span><span class="answer">1976–77</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572749d7dd62a815002e9a94"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first television series to feature an openly gay character?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Soap</span><span class="answer">Soap</span><span class="answer">Soap</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Meanwhile, ABC News, which formed as a newly separate division, sought to become a global leader in television news.

The company first constructed a new 10-story building on land previously occupied by an abandoned warehouse on the corner of Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street; the facility that was built in its place is nicknamed &quot;7 Lincoln Square&quot; (although it is actually located at 149 Columbus Avenue). Meanwhile, a former parking lot, located at 30 West 67th Street, was transformed into an impressive 15-story building. Both buildings were completed in June 1979. WABC-TV moved its operations from offices at 77 West 66th Street to 149 Columbus Avenue, freeing up space for the ABC network to house some of its operations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274a8cf1498d1400e8f5b4"><p> <strong class="question">Who was named the president of ABC News in 1977?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Roone Arledge</span><span class="answer">Roone Arledge</span><span class="answer">Roone Arledge</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274a8cf1498d1400e8f5b5"><p> <strong class="question">Besides ABC News, what other division was Roone Arledge president of?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ABC Sports</span><span class="answer">ABC Sports</span><span class="answer">ABC Sports</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274a8cf1498d1400e8f5b6"><p> <strong class="question">What is the nickname for the ABC facility built at Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">7 Lincoln Square</span><span class="answer">7 Lincoln Square</span><span class="answer">7 Lincoln Square</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274a8cf1498d1400e8f5b7"><p> <strong class="question">When was 7 Lincoln Square completed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">June 1979</span><span class="answer">June 1979</span><span class="answer">1979</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In June 1978, Arledge created the newsmagazine 20/20; after its first episode received harshly negative reviews, the program – which debuted as a summer series, before becoming a year-round program in 1979 – was immediately revamped to feature a mix of in-depth stories and interviews, with Hugh Downs appointed as its anchor (later paired alongside his former Today colleague Barbara Walters).

Both stations were acquired as a contingency plan in the event that CBS reached an affiliation deal with WXYZ-TV (to replace WJBK, which switched to Fox as a result of that network's group affiliation agreement with New World Communications) in order to allow the network to retain some over-the-air presence in the Detroit market (the E.W.

One of the network's strike-replacement programs during that time was the game show Duel, which premiered in December 2007. The program would become a minor success for the network during its initial six-episode run, which led ABC to renew Duel as a regular series starting in April 2008.

Meanwhile, the new lows hit by Brothers &amp; Sisters led to its cancellation, and the previous year's only drama renewal, V, also failed to earn another season after a low-rated midseason run.

The network's finances improved and allowed it to invest in other properties and programming. In May 1960, ABC purchased Chicago radio station WLS, which had shared airtime with WENR since the 1920s. This acquisition allowed ABC to consolidate its presence in the market. On May 9, 1960, WLS launched a new lineup consisting of ABC Radio programming. In 1960, Canadian entrepreneur John Bassett, who was trying to establish a television station in Toronto, sought the help of ABC to launch the station. Leonard Goldenson agreed to acquire a 25% interest in CFTO-TV; however, legislation by the Canadian Radio-Television Commission prohibited ABC's involvement, resulting in the company withdrawing from the project before the station's launch.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57275e125951b619008f88d7"><p> <strong class="question">What radio station did ABC purchase in May 1960?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">WLS</span><span class="answer">WLS</span><span class="answer">WLS</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57275e125951b619008f88d8"><p> <strong class="question">When did WLS launch a lineup of ABC radio programs?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">May 9, 1960</span><span class="answer">May 9, 1960</span><span class="answer">May 9, 1960</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57275e125951b619008f88d9"><p> <strong class="question">What Canadian investor sought ABC's help in launching a station in 1960?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">John Bassett</span><span class="answer">John Bassett</span><span class="answer">John Bassett</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57275e125951b619008f88da"><p> <strong class="question">What project did Leonard Goldenson offer to invest in before the Canadian Radio-Television Commission ruled against ABC?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">CFTO-TV</span><span class="answer">CFTO-TV</span><span class="answer">CFTO-TV</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Always in search of new programs that would help it compete with NBC and CBS, ABC's management believed that sports could be a major catalyst in improving the network's market share.

In December of that year, the ABC television network premiered The Dating Game, a pioneer series in its genre, which was a reworking of the blind date concept in which a suitor selected one of three contestants sight unseen based on the answers to selected questions. This was followed up in July 1966 by The Newlywed Game, featuring three recently married couples who guessed the responses to their partner's questions (some of which were fairly risque). As ABC began to outgrow its facilities at 7 West 66th Street, Goldenson found a new headquarters for ABC in a 44 story building located at 1330 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, at the corner of 54th Street (now occupied by The Financial Times's New York office).

The network was also propelled during the early 1980s by the continued successes of Happy Days, Three's Company, Laverne &amp; Shirley and Fantasy Island, and gained new hits in Too Close for Comfort, Soap spinoff Benson and Happy Days spinoff Mork &amp; Mindy.

In June 1984, ABC's executive committee approved the company's interest acquisition in ESPN, and ABC arranged with Getty Oil to obtain an 80% stake in the channel, while selling the remaining 20% to Nabisco. That year, ABC and Hearst reached an agreement with RCA to merge ARTS and competing arts service, The Entertainment Channel, into a single cable channel called Arts &amp; Entertainment Television (A&amp;E); the new channel subsequently leased a separate satellite transponder, ending its sharing agreement with Nickelodeon to become a 24-hour service.

However that year, ABC had only 14 primary affiliates compared to the 74 that carried the majority of CBS programs and the 71 that were primarily affiliated with NBC. Most markets outside the largest ones were not large enough to support three full-time network affiliates. In some markets that were large enough for a third full-time affiliate, the only available commercial allocation was on the less-desirable UHF band. Until the All-Channel Receiver Act (passed by Congress in 1961) mandated the inclusion of UHF tuning, most viewers needed to purchase a converter to be able to watch UHF stations, and the signal quality was marginal at best even with a converter. Additionally, during the analog television era, UHF stations were not adequately receivable in rugged terrain. These factors made many prospective station owners skittish about investing in a UHF station, especially one that would have had to take on an affiliation with a weaker network.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57276c64f1498d1400e8f7b2"><p> <strong class="question">How many primary affiliates did ABC have in 1954?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">14</span><span class="answer">14</span><span class="answer">14</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57276c64f1498d1400e8f7b3"><p> <strong class="question">How many primary affiliates did CBS have in 1954?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">74</span><span class="answer">74</span><span class="answer">71</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57276c64f1498d1400e8f7b4"><p> <strong class="question">What important legislation was passed by Congress for the television industry in 1961?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">All-Channel Receiver Act</span><span class="answer">All-Channel Receiver Act</span><span class="answer">All-Channel Receiver Act</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57276c64f1498d1400e8f7b5"><p> <strong class="question">The All-Channel Receiver Act mandated the support of what kind of tuning?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">UHF tuning</span><span class="answer">UHF</span><span class="answer">UHF</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As a result, with the exception of the largest markets, ABC was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations, usually via off-hours clearances (a notable exception during this time was WKST-TV in Youngstown, Ohio, now WYTV, despite the small size of the surrounding market and its close proximity to Cleveland and Pittsburgh even decades before the city's economic collapse). According to Goldenson, this meant that an hour of ABC programming reported five times lower viewership than its competitors. However, the network's intake of money at the time would allow it to accelerate its content production. Still, ABC's limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades; several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full-time ABC affiliate until the 1960s, with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s, which allowed stations like WTRF-TV in Wheeling, West Virginia to begin airing ABC programming on a digital subchannel after airing the network's programs outside of recommended timeslots decades before.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57276d7f708984140094dd3f"><p> <strong class="question">ABC had secondary status on the existing stations in what Ohio town?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Youngstown</span><span class="answer">WKST-TV in Youngstown</span><span class="answer">Youngstown</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57276d7f708984140094dd40"><p> <strong class="question">Relegation to secondary status for ABC resulted in viewership how much lower than their competitors, according to Goldenson?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">five times lower viewership</span><span class="answer">five times</span><span class="answer">five times</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57276d7f708984140094dd41"><p> <strong class="question">The beginnings of digital television allowed what affiliate in Wheeling, West Virginia to begin airing ABC programs digitally?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">WTRF-TV</span><span class="answer">WTRF-TV</span><span class="answer">WTRF-TV</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57276d7f708984140094dd42"><p> <strong class="question">Very small markets had to wait until what decade to support an ABC affiliate?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1980s</span><span class="answer">1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s</span><span class="answer">1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On September 3, 1958, the Disneyland anthology series was retitled Walt Disney Presents as it became disassociated with the theme park of the same name. The movement in westerns, which ABC is credited for having started, represented a fifth of all primetime series on American television in January 1959, at which point detective shows were beginning to rise in popularity as well. ABC requested additional productions from Disney. In late 1958, Desilu Productions pitched its detective series The Untouchables to CBS; after that network rejected the show because of its use of violence, Desilu then presented it to ABC, which agreed to pick up the show, and debuted The Untouchables in April 1959. The series went on to quickly become &quot;immensely popular&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57276f82dd62a815002e9cd0"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Disneyland anthology series retitled in 1958?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Walt Disney Presents</span><span class="answer">Walt Disney Presents</span><span class="answer">Walt Disney Presents</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57276f82dd62a815002e9cd1"><p> <strong class="question">What production company pitched The Untouchables to CBS in 1958?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Desilu Productions</span><span class="answer">Desilu Productions</span><span class="answer">Desilu Productions</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57276f82dd62a815002e9cd2"><p> <strong class="question">Why did CBS turn down the pitch for The Untouchables?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">its use of violence</span><span class="answer">its use of violence</span><span class="answer">violence</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57276f82dd62a815002e9cd3"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Untouchables debut on ABC?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">April 1959</span><span class="answer">April 1959</span><span class="answer">April 1959</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Due to pressure from film studios wanting to increase their production, as the major networks began airing theatrically released films, ABC joined CBS and NBC in broadcasting films on Sunday nights in 1962, with the launch of the ABC Sunday Night Movie, which debuted a year behind its competitors and was initially presented in black-and-white. Despite a significant increase in viewership (with its audience share having increased to 33% from the 15% share it had in 1953), ABC remained in third place; the company had a total revenue of $15.5 million, a third of the revenue pulled in by CBS at the same period. To catch up, ABC followed up The Flintstones with another animated series from Hanna-Barbera, The Jetsons, which debuted on September 23, 1962 as the first television series to be broadcast in color on the network. On April 1, 1963, ABC debuted the soap opera General Hospital, which would go on to become the television network's long-running entertainment program. That year also saw the premiere of The Fugitive (on September 17), a drama series centering on a man on the run after being accused of committing a murder he did not commit.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727705f5951b619008f89f3"><p> <strong class="question">What was the title of ABC's broadcast film program that debuted on Sundays in 1962?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ABC Sunday Night Movie</span><span class="answer">ABC Sunday Night Movie</span><span class="answer">ABC Sunday Night Movie</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727705f5951b619008f89f4"><p> <strong class="question">What was ABC's revenue in 1962?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">$15.5 million</span><span class="answer">$15.5</span><span class="answer">$15.5 million</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727705f5951b619008f89f5"><p> <strong class="question">What production company produced the animated series The Flintstones for ABC?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Hanna-Barbera</span><span class="answer">Hanna-Barbera</span><span class="answer">Hanna-Barbera</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727705f5951b619008f89f6"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first series to be televised in color on ABC?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Jetsons</span><span class="answer">The Jetsons</span><span class="answer">The Jetsons</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727705f5951b619008f89f7"><p> <strong class="question">When did General Hospital first debut on ABC?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">April 1, 1963</span><span class="answer">April 1, 1963</span><span class="answer">April 1, 1963</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On December 7, 1965, Goldenson announced a merger proposal with ITT to ABC management; the two companies agreed to the deal on April 27, 1966.

On March 16, 1985, ABC's executive committee accepted the merger offer, which was formally announced on March 18, 1985, with Capital Cities purchasing ABC and its related properties for $3.5 billion and $118 for each of ABC's shares as well as a guarantee of 10% (or $3) for a total of $121 per share. To finance the purchase, Capital Cities borrowed $2.1 billion from a consortium of banks, which sold certain assets that Capital Cites could not acquire or retain due to FCC ownership rules for a combined $900 million and sold off several cable television systems, which were sold to The Washington Post Company (forming the present-day Cable One). The remaining $500 million was loaned by Warren Buffett, who promised that his company Berkshire Hathaway would purchase $3 million in shares, at $172.50 apiece. Due to an FCC ban on same-market ownership of television and radio stations by a single company (although the deal would have otherwise complied with new ownership rules implemented by the FCC in January 1985, that allowed broadcasters to own a maximum of 12 television stations), ABC and Capital Cities respectively decided to sell WXYZ-TV and Tampa independent station WFTS-TV to the E.

In 1957, ABC Entertainment president Ollie Treiz discovered that the locally produced variety show Bandstand had pulled very strong ratings in the Philadelphia market on WFIL-TV; Treiz ultimately negotiated a deal to take the show national, under the revised title American Bandstand; the show quickly became a social phenomenon by presenting new musical talent and dances to America's youth and helped make a star out of its host, Dick Clark.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727780a5951b619008f8a9d"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of programs can be credited for ABC's success in the late 1950s?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">westerns and detective series</span><span class="answer">westerns and detective series</span><span class="answer">westerns and detective series</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727780a5951b619008f8a9e"><p> <strong class="question">How much did advertising revenue increase for ABC between 1953 and 1958?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">500%</span><span class="answer">almost 500%</span><span class="answer">500%</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727780a5951b619008f8a9f"><p> <strong class="question">What was the national viewership reach of ABC in 1958?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">between 10% and 18%</span><span class="answer">between 10% and 18%</span><span class="answer">10% and 18%</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727780a5951b619008f8aa0"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the ABC Entertainment president in 1957?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Ollie Treiz</span><span class="answer">Ollie Treiz</span><span class="answer">Ollie Treiz</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727780a5951b619008f8aa1"><p> <strong class="question">Who hosted the bandstand show debuted on ABC in 1957?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Dick Clark</span><span class="answer">Dick Clark</span><span class="answer">Dick Clark</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>These kinds of programs presented ABC with an image of the &quot;philosophy of counterprogramming against its competitors&quot;, offering a strong lineup of programs that contrasted with those seen on its rival networks, which helped Goldenson give the network a continuum between film and television. ABC's western series (as well as series such as the actioner Zorro) went up against and defeated the variety shows aired by NBC and CBS in the fall of 1957, and its detective shows did the same in the fall of 1959. To captivate the network's audiences, short 66-minute series were scheduled a half-hour before their hour-long competition. In May 1961, Life criticized the public enthusiasm and sponsorship for these types of shows at the expense of news programming and denounced an unofficial law &quot;replacing the good programs with the bad ones&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57277944f1498d1400e8f90a"><p> <strong class="question">What was the programming philosophy pioneered by ABC and Goldenson?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">counterprogramming</span><span class="answer">counterprogramming against its competitors</span><span class="answer">&quot;philosophy of counterprogramming against its competitors&quot;</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57277944f1498d1400e8f90b"><p> <strong class="question">What ABC action series went up against NBC's variety shows in Fall 1957?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Zorro</span><span class="answer">Zorro</span><span class="answer">Zorro</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57277944f1498d1400e8f90c"><p> <strong class="question">What magazine criticized ABC's programming strategy in May 1961?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Life</span><span class="answer">Life</span><span class="answer">Life</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57277944f1498d1400e8f90d"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of shows were used as counterprogramming by ABC in the Fall of 1959?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">detective shows</span><span class="answer">detective</span><span class="answer">detective</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In May 2013, ABC launched &quot;WATCH ABC&quot;, a revamp of its traditional multi-platform streaming services encompassing the network's existing streaming portal at ABC.com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers; in addition to providing full-length episodes of ABC programs, the service allows live programming streams of local ABC affiliates in select markets (the first such offering by a U.S. broadcast network).
