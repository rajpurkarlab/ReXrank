The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament – the areas in which it can make laws – by explicitly specifying powers that are &quot;reserved&quot; to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster. The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament, and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws. The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fac17947a6a140053cb54"><p> <strong class="question">When was the current parliament of Scotland convened?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Following a referendum in 1997</span><span class="answer">1998</span><span class="answer">1998</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fac17947a6a140053cb55"><p> <strong class="question">What act set out the Parliament's powers as a devolved legislature?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Scotland Act 1998</span><span class="answer">Scotland Act 1998</span><span class="answer">Scotland Act</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fac17947a6a140053cb56"><p> <strong class="question">The legislative competence of the Parliament species what areas?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">in which it can make laws</span><span class="answer">the areas in which it can make laws</span><span class="answer">powers that are &quot;reserved&quot; to the Parliament of the United Kingdom</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fac17947a6a140053cb57"><p> <strong class="question">To what body are certain powers explicitly specified as being reserved for?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Parliament of the United Kingdom</span><span class="answer">Parliament of the United Kingdom</span><span class="answer">The British Parliament</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fac17947a6a140053cb58"><p> <strong class="question">The Scottish Parliament may legislate as it pleases as long as the powers aren't already reserved by where?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Westminster</span><span class="answer">Westminster</span><span class="answer">Westminster</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For the next three hundred years, Scotland was directly governed by the Parliament of Great Britain and the subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom, both seated at Westminster, and the lack of a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in Scottish national identity. Suggestions for a 'devolved' Parliament were made before 1914, but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War. A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution. One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom. Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572facb0a23a5019007fc863"><p> <strong class="question">What remained an important issue in Scottish national identity for many years?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">lack of a Parliament of Scotland</span><span class="answer">the lack of a Parliament of Scotland</span><span class="answer">the lack of a Parliament of Scotland</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572facb0a23a5019007fc864"><p> <strong class="question">How many hundred of years was Scotland directly governed by the parliament of Great Britain?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">three hundred</span><span class="answer">three hundred years</span><span class="answer">three hundred years</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572facb0a23a5019007fc865"><p> <strong class="question">Why were the initial suggestions for a devolved parliament before 1914 shelved?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">First World War.</span><span class="answer">First World War</span><span class="answer">the outbreak of the First World War</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572facb0a23a5019007fc866"><p> <strong class="question">When was there a sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the late 1960s</span><span class="answer">late 1960s</span><span class="answer">late 1960s</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572facb0a23a5019007fc867"><p> <strong class="question">What did Kllbrandon's report in 1973 recommend establishing?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">directly elected Scottish Assembly</span><span class="answer">directly elected Scottish Assembly</span><span class="answer">a directly elected Scottish Assembly</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>During this time, the discovery of oil in the North Sea and the following &quot;It's Scotland's oil&quot; campaign of the Scottish National Party (SNP) resulted in rising support for Scottish independence, as well as the SNP.

Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn's Skating Minister. Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture.

The Presiding Officer and deputies are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 MSPs, which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament. Principally, the role of the Presiding Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. When chairing meetings of the Parliament, the Presiding Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial. During debates, the Presiding Officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings. A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fb42904bcaa1900d76c15"><p> <strong class="question">Who is elected to serve as the Presiding Officer at the beginning of each parliamentary session?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">one MSP</span><span class="answer">MSP</span><span class="answer">MSP</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fb42904bcaa1900d76c16"><p> <strong class="question">Who is currently speaker of the Scottish Parliament?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Tricia Marwick</span><span class="answer">Tricia Marwick</span><span class="answer">Tricia Marwick</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fb42904bcaa1900d76c17"><p> <strong class="question">What type of ballot is used to elect the Presiding Officer and deputies of the Parliament?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">secret</span><span class="answer">secret</span><span class="answer">a secret ballot</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fb42904bcaa1900d76c18"><p> <strong class="question">How many MSPs are there?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">129</span><span class="answer">129</span><span class="answer">129</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fb42904bcaa1900d76c19"><p> <strong class="question">Who is responsible for operating the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">A vote clerk</span><span class="answer">vote clerk</span><span class="answer">vote clerk</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>As a member of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Presiding Officer is responsible for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate.

As such the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but, as they are not elected MSPs, cannot vote. Members are able to sit anywhere in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings. The First Minister, Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers sit in the front row, in the middle section of the chamber. The largest party in the Parliament sits in the middle of the semicircle, with opposing parties on either side.

Normally, the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems.

Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use Scots, Gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer.

Parties entrust some MSPs, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line. MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare. In some circumstances, however, parties announce &quot;free votes&quot;, which allows Members to vote as they please.

Any member can put their name forward to be First Minister, and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament. Normally, the leader of the largest party is returned as First Minister, and head of the Scottish Government. Theoretically, Parliament also elects the Scottish Ministers who form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet, but such ministers are, in practice, appointed to their roles by the First Minister. Junior ministers, who do not attend cabinet, are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments. Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs, with the exception of Scotland's Chief Law Officers: the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General. Whilst the First Minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the Sovereign.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd47fa23a5019007fca55"><p> <strong class="question">What party forms the Scottish Parliament?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">hold the majority of seats</span><span class="answer">hold the majority of seats</span><span class="answer">The party, or parties, that hold the majority of seats in the Parliament</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd47fa23a5019007fca57"><p> <strong class="question">Who is eligible to toss their name in the hat to be First Minister?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Any member</span><span class="answer">Any member</span><span class="answer">Any member</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd47fa23a5019007fca56"><p> <strong class="question">Who is elected at the beginning of each term?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">First Minister</span><span class="answer">First Minister</span><span class="answer">a First Minister</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd47fa23a5019007fca58"><p> <strong class="question">Other than Scotland's Chief Law Officer, from whence are most ministers drawn from amongst?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">elected MSPs</span><span class="answer">the elected MSPs</span><span class="answer">amongst the elected MSPs</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd47fa23a5019007fca59"><p> <strong class="question">Who makes formal appointment or dismissal decisions?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Sovereign</span><span class="answer">the Sovereign</span><span class="answer">the Sovereign</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Under the Scotland Act 1998, ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on).

After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd73e947a6a140053cd32"><p> <strong class="question">What enables the Scottish Parliament to scrutinize the government?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Several procedures</span><span class="answer">Several procedures</span><span class="answer">Several procedures</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd73e947a6a140053cd33"><p> <strong class="question">Who can question statements the First Minister or members of the cabinet make?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">MSPs</span><span class="answer">leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs</span><span class="answer">MSPs</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd73e947a6a140053cd34"><p> <strong class="question">What does the First Minister deliver at the beginning of each parliamentary year?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">legislative programme for the forthcoming year</span><span class="answer">a statement</span><span class="answer">a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd73e947a6a140053cd35"><p> <strong class="question">What do the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister about?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">issues related to the substance of the statement</span><span class="answer">issues</span><span class="answer">issues related to the substance of the statement</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Parliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber. A &quot;General Question Time&quot; takes place on a Thursday between 11:40 a.m. and 12 p.m. where members can direct questions to any member of the Scottish Government. At 2.30pm, a 40-minute long themed &quot;Question Time&quot; takes place, where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day, such as health and justice or education and transport. Between 12 p.m. and 12:30 p.m. on Thursdays, when Parliament is sitting, First Minister's Question Time takes place. This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction. Opposition leaders ask a general question of the First Minister and then supplementary questions. Such a practice enables a &quot;lead-in&quot; to the questioner, who then uses their supplementary question to ask the First Minister any issue. The four general questions available to opposition leaders are:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd7b8947a6a140053cd3a"><p> <strong class="question">What is set aside for question periods in the debating chamber?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Parliamentary time</span><span class="answer">Parliamentary time</span><span class="answer">Parliamentary time</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd7b8947a6a140053cd3b"><p> <strong class="question">On what day does a General Question Time take place?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Thursday</span><span class="answer">Thursday</span><span class="answer">Thursday</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd7b8947a6a140053cd3c"><p> <strong class="question">Who may members direct questions towards during General Question Time?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">any member of the Scottish Government</span><span class="answer">any member of the Scottish Government</span><span class="answer">ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd7b8947a6a140053cd3d"><p> <strong class="question">What may members question the First Minister about directly during First Minister's Question Time?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">issues under their jurisdiction</span><span class="answer">issues under their jurisdiction</span><span class="answer">the First Minister</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd7b8947a6a140053cd3e"><p> <strong class="question">How many general questions are available to opposition leaders?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">four</span><span class="answer">four</span><span class="answer">four</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Of the 129 MSPs, 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as &quot;Constituency MSPs&quot;. Voters choose one member to represent the constituency, and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP. The 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the UK Parliament constituencies in Scotland, prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish MPs, with the exception of Orkney and Shetland which each return their own constituency MSP. Currently, the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors. Given the geographical distribution of population in Scotland, this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the Central Lowlands, where the bulk of Scotland's population live, and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country, which have a low population density. The island archipelagos of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles comprise a much smaller number of electors, due to their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. If a Constituency MSP resigns from Parliament, this triggers a by-election in his or her constituency, where a replacement MSP is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd8efb2c2fd14005684f9"><p> <strong class="question">What is the number of Constituency MSPs?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">73</span><span class="answer">73</span><span class="answer">73</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd8efb2c2fd14005684fb"><p> <strong class="question">When was there a reduction in the number of Scottish MPs?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2005</span><span class="answer">2005</span><span class="answer">2005</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd8efb2c2fd14005684fa"><p> <strong class="question">How many members can voters choose to represent the constituency? </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">one</span><span class="answer">one</span><span class="answer">one</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd8efb2c2fd14005684fd"><p> <strong class="question">Why do the island archipelagos comprise a smaller number of electors?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">dispersed population and distance</span><span class="answer">dispersed population and distance</span><span class="answer">their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572fd8efb2c2fd14005684fc"><p> <strong class="question">What is the current number of electors currently in a Scottish Parliament constituency? </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">55,000</span><span class="answer">55,000</span><span class="answer">55,000</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The total number of seats in the Parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method.
