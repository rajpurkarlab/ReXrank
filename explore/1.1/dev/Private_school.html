Tuition at private secondary schools varies from school to school and depends on many factors, including the location of the school, the willingness of parents to pay, peer tuitions and the school's financial endowment. High tuition, schools claim, is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers and also used to provide enriched learning environments, including a low student to teacher ratio, small class sizes and services, such as libraries, science laboratories and computers.

Some schools offer the removal of the purported distractions of co-education; the presence of boarding facilities; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion, a tool not readily available to government schools. Student uniforms for Australian private schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example, a compulsory blazer.

Therefore, most Ersatzschulen have very low tuition fees and/or offer scholarships, compared to most other Western European countries. However, it is not possible to finance these schools with such low tuition fees, which is why all German Ersatzschulen are additionally financed with public funds.

So, in a strict sense, a private school is an unaided independent school. For the purpose of this definition, only receipt of financial aid is considered, not land purchased from the government at a subsidized rate. It is within the power of both the union government and the state governments to govern schools since Education appears in the Concurrent list of legislative subjects in the constitution. The practice has been for the union government to provide the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations for the administration of the sector. Among other things, this has also resulted in 30 different Examination Boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates.

They will have to satisfy a number of infrastructure and human resource related criteria to get Recognition (a form of license) from the government. Critics of this system point out that this leads to corruption by school inspectors who check compliance and to fewer schools in a country that has the largest adult illiterate population in the world. While official data does not capture the real extent of private schooling in the country, various studies have reported unpopularity of government schools and an increasing number of private schools. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), which evaluates learning levels in rural India, has been reporting poorer academic achievement in government schools than in private schools. A key difference between the government and private schools is that the medium of education in private schools is English while it is the local language in government schools.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274ca8dd62a815002e9aa4"><p> <strong class="question">Along with trusts, what other non-profits are allowed to run schools in India?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">societies</span><span class="answer">societies</span><span class="answer">societies</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274ca8dd62a815002e9aa5"><p> <strong class="question">What country has the most illiterate adults in the world?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">India</span><span class="answer">India</span><span class="answer">India</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274ca8dd62a815002e9aa6"><p> <strong class="question">What is the full name of the ASER?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Annual Status of Education Report</span><span class="answer">Annual Status of Education Report</span><span class="answer">Annual Status of Education Report</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274ca8dd62a815002e9aa7"><p> <strong class="question">What is the purpose of the ASER?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">evaluates learning levels in rural India</span><span class="answer">evaluates learning levels in rural India</span><span class="answer">evaluates learning levels in rural India</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274ca8dd62a815002e9aa8"><p> <strong class="question">In private schools, what language are classes taught in?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">English</span><span class="answer">English</span><span class="answer">English</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Ireland, private schools (Irish: scoil phríobháideach) are unusual because a certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the State. If the school wishes to employ extra teachers they are paid for with school fees, which tend to be relatively low in Ireland compared to the rest of the world. There is, however, a limited element of state assessment of private schools, because of the requirement that the state ensure that children receive a certain minimum education; Irish private schools must still work towards the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate, for example. Many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools. The average fee is around €5,000 annually for most schools, but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to €25,000 per year. The fee-paying schools are usually run by a religious order, i.e., the Society of Jesus or Congregation of Christian Brothers, etc.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274d1cdd62a815002e9aae"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Irish term for private schools?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">scoil phríobháideach</span><span class="answer">scoil phríobháideach</span><span class="answer">scoil phríobháideach</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274d1cdd62a815002e9aaf"><p> <strong class="question">How do private schools in Ireland differ from most?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">teacher's salaries are paid by the State</span><span class="answer">a certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the State</span><span class="answer">certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the State</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274d1cdd62a815002e9ab0"><p> <strong class="question">What is the typical annual cost for an Irish private school?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">€5,000</span><span class="answer">€5,000</span><span class="answer">€5,000</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274d1cdd62a815002e9ab1"><p> <strong class="question">Along with the Congregation of Christian Brothers, what is a notable religious group that runs fee-paying schools in Ireland?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Society of Jesus</span><span class="answer">the Society of Jesus</span><span class="answer">Society of Jesus</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274d1cdd62a815002e9ab2"><p> <strong class="question">What might the fees to attend an Irish boarding school rise to?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">€25,000 per year</span><span class="answer">€25,000</span><span class="answer">€25,000 per year</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After Malaysia's independence in 1957, the government instructed all schools to surrender their properties and be assimilated into the National School system.

Private school numbers have been in decline since the mid-1970s as a result of many private schools opting to become state-integrated schools, mostly due of financial difficulties stemming from changes in student numbers and/or the economy. State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school, e.g. they must teach the state curriculum, they must employ registered teachers, and they can't charge tuition fees (they can charge &quot;attendance dues&quot; for the upkeep on the still-private school land and buildings). The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984, when the nation's then-private Catholic school system integrated. As a result, private schools in New Zealand are now largely restricted to the largest cities (Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch) and niche markets.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274eca5951b619008f87ff"><p> <strong class="question">How many private schools existed in New Zealand in April 2014?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">88</span><span class="answer">88</span><span class="answer">88</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274eca5951b619008f8800"><p> <strong class="question">In April 2014, how many New Zealand students attended private schools?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">28,000</span><span class="answer">28,000</span><span class="answer">28,000</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274eca5951b619008f8801"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of New Zealand students attended private schools in April 2014?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">3.7</span><span class="answer">3.7%</span><span class="answer">3.7</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274eca5951b619008f8802"><p> <strong class="question">What religion's schools were integrated into New Zealand public schools between 1979 and 1984?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Catholic</span><span class="answer">Catholic</span><span class="answer">Catholic</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57274eca5951b619008f8803"><p> <strong class="question">What city, along with Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch, is one of the largest in New Zealand?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Auckland</span><span class="answer">Auckland</span><span class="answer">Auckland</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Private schools are often Anglican, such as King's College and Diocesan School for Girls in Auckland, St Paul's Collegiate School in Hamilton, St Peter's School in Cambridge, Samuel Marsden Collegiate School in Wellington, and Christ's College and St Margaret's College in Christchurch; or Presbyterian, such as Saint Kentigern College and St Cuthbert's College in Auckland, Scots College and Queen Margaret College in Wellington, and St Andrew's College and Rangi Ruru Girls' School in Christchurch.

Some of these are also known as public schools. Preparatory schools in the UK prepare pupils aged up to 13 years old to enter public schools. The name &quot;public school&quot; is based on the fact that the schools were open to pupils from anywhere, and not merely to those from a certain locality, and of any religion or occupation. According to The Good Schools Guide approximately 9 per cent of children being educated in the UK are doing so at fee-paying schools at GSCE level and 13 per cent at A-level.[citation needed] Many independent schools are single-sex (though this is becoming less common). Fees range from under £3,000 to £21,000 and above per year for day pupils, rising to £27,000+ per year for boarders.
