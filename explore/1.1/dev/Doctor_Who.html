The programme depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lord—a space and time-travelling humanoid alien. He explores the universe in his TARDIS, a sentient time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes, while working to save civilisations and help people in need.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727efabff5b5019007d98e2"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the producer of Doctor Who?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">BBC</span><span class="answer">BBC</span><span class="answer">BBC</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727efabff5b5019007d98e3"><p> <strong class="question">What year did Doctor Who first show on TV?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1963</span><span class="answer">1963</span><span class="answer">1963</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727efabff5b5019007d98e4"><p> <strong class="question">What is Doctor Who's space ship called?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">TARDIS</span><span class="answer">TARDIS</span><span class="answer">TARDIS</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727efabff5b5019007d98e5"><p> <strong class="question">What does the outside of the Tardis resemble?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a blue British police box</span><span class="answer">a blue British police box</span><span class="answer">blue British police box</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727efabff5b5019007d98e6"><p> <strong class="question">What type/genre of TV show is Doctor Who?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">science-fiction</span><span class="answer">science-fiction</span><span class="answer">science-fiction</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The show is a significant part of British popular culture, and elsewhere it has become a cult television favourite. The show has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot, in the form of a television film. The programme was relaunched in 2005 by Russell T Davies, who was showrunner and head writer for the first five years of its revival, produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff. The first series of the 21st century featured Christopher Eccleston in the title role and was produced by the BBC. Doctor Who also spawned spin-offs in multiple media, including Torchwood (2006–2011) and The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007–2011), both created by Russell T Davies; K-9 (2009–2010); and a single pilot episode of K-9 and Company (1981). There also have been many spoofs and cultural references to the character in other media.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f0b1ff5b5019007d98f2"><p> <strong class="question">In what years did Doctor Who originally show on TV?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1963 to 1989</span><span class="answer">1963 to 1989</span><span class="answer">1963 to 1989</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f0b1ff5b5019007d98f3"><p> <strong class="question">Who relaunched Doctor Who in 2005?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Russell T Davies</span><span class="answer">2005</span><span class="answer">Russell T Davies</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f0b1ff5b5019007d98f4"><p> <strong class="question">What Doctor Who spin-off only made it as far as a pilot episode?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">K-9 and Company</span><span class="answer">K-9 and Company</span><span class="answer">K-9 and Company</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f0b1ff5b5019007d98f5"><p> <strong class="question">Who produced the Doctor Who revival series?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">BBC Wales</span><span class="answer">Russell T Davies</span><span class="answer">BBC Wales</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f0b1ff5b5019007d98f6"><p> <strong class="question">Who played Doctor Who in the revival series?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Christopher Eccleston</span><span class="answer">Christopher Eccleston</span><span class="answer">Christopher Eccleston</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Twelve actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show, as well as the differing approach to the role that each brings, under the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation. The show's premise is that this is a life process of Time Lords through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality, which occurs after sustaining an injury which would be fatal to most other species. Each actor's portrayal differs, but they are all intended to be aspects of the same character and form part of the same storyline. The time-travelling nature of the plot means that, on occasion, different Doctors have met each other. Peter Capaldi took on the role after Matt Smith's exit in the 2013 Christmas special &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f18c3acd2414000df063"><p> <strong class="question">How many actors have played Doctor Who?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Twelve</span><span class="answer">Twelve</span><span class="answer">Twelve</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f18c3acd2414000df064"><p> <strong class="question">Who followed Matt Smith in the role of Doctor Who?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Peter Capaldi</span><span class="answer">Peter Capaldi</span><span class="answer">Peter Capaldi</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f18c3acd2414000df065"><p> <strong class="question">Which episode was Matt Smith's final one as Doctor Who?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Time of the Doctor</span><span class="answer">the 2013 Christmas special &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;</span><span class="answer">&quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f18c3acd2414000df066"><p> <strong class="question">When does Doctor Who transition to a new body?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">after sustaining an injury</span><span class="answer">after sustaining an injury which would be fatal to most other species</span><span class="answer">after sustaining an injury</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f18c3acd2414000df067"><p> <strong class="question">In addition to a new body, what else changes about the Doctor?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">new personality</span><span class="answer">new personality</span><span class="answer">new personality</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Doctor Who follows the adventures of the primary character, a rogue Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who simply goes by the name &quot;The Doctor&quot;.

It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama, Canadian Sydney Newman, was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.[note 1] The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any &quot;bug-eyed monsters&quot;. The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but The Mutants was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it. According to producer Verity Lambert; &quot;We didn't have a lot of choice — we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.&quot; Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial – The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f44c2ca10214002d9a32"><p> <strong class="question">What was the date of the very first episode of Doctor Who?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">23 November 1963</span><span class="answer">Saturday, 23 November 1963</span><span class="answer">23 November 1963</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f44c2ca10214002d9a33"><p> <strong class="question">What creatures were the most popular monsters in the series?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Daleks (a.k.a.

Segal's negotiations eventually led to a Doctor Who television film, broadcast on the Fox Network in 1996 as a co-production between Fox, Universal Pictures, the BBC and BBC Worldwide. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1 million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f678ff5b5019007d9956"><p> <strong class="question">What was the BBC hoping that an independent production firm would do for Doctor Who?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">relaunch the show</span><span class="answer">relaunch the show</span><span class="answer">relaunch the show</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f678ff5b5019007d9957"><p> <strong class="question">Who approached the BBC in 1989 about relaunching the show?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Philip Segal</span><span class="answer">Philip Segal</span><span class="answer">Philip Segal</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f678ff5b5019007d9958"><p> <strong class="question">What network showed a Doctor Who film?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Fox Network</span><span class="answer">Fox Network</span><span class="answer">the Fox Network</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f678ff5b5019007d9959"><p> <strong class="question">How many UK viewers watched the Doctor Who film?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">9.1 million</span><span class="answer">9.1 million</span><span class="answer">9.1 million</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5727f678ff5b5019007d995a"><p> <strong class="question">In what country was the Doctor Who film not successful enough to spawn a series?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the United States</span><span class="answer">United States</span><span class="answer">the United States</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Doctor Who finally returned with the episode &quot;Rose&quot; on BBC One on 26 March 2005.

Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a storyline, such as season 8 being devoted to the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called The Master, season 16's quest for The Key to Time, season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20's Black Guardian Trilogy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572800b03acd2414000df1f1"><p> <strong class="question">How many seasons did the original Doctor Who run?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">26</span><span class="answer">26</span><span class="answer">26</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572800b03acd2414000df1f2"><p> <strong class="question">When was the last episode of the original series?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">6 December 1989</span><span class="answer">6 December 1989</span><span class="answer">6 December 1989</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572800b03acd2414000df1f3"><p> <strong class="question">How many episodes were in The Daleks' Master Plan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">12</span><span class="answer">12</span><span class="answer">12</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572800b03acd2414000df1f4"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of a Time Lord that Doctor Who has fought?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Master</span><span class="answer">The Master</span><span class="answer">The Master</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572800b03acd2414000df1f5"><p> <strong class="question">What was the focus of Season 20 of Doctor Who?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Black Guardian Trilogy</span><span class="answer">Black Guardian Trilogy</span><span class="answer">Black Guardian Trilogy</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with each series usually consisting of 13 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended episode broadcast on Christmas Day.

Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes &quot;Journey's End&quot; from 2008 and &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; from 2010 exceeded an hour in length.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572801823acd2414000df1fb"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the serial format change for the Doctor Who series?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2005</span><span class="answer">2005</span><span class="answer">2005</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572801823acd2414000df1fc"><p> <strong class="question">How long was each Doctor Who episode in the 2005 revival series (including ads)?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">60 minutes</span><span class="answer">45-minute</span><span class="answer">60 minutes</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572801823acd2414000df1fd"><p> <strong class="question">When was an extended episode of Doctor Who shown?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Christmas Day</span><span class="answer">Christmas Day</span><span class="answer">Christmas Day</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572801823acd2414000df1fe"><p> <strong class="question">Which episode in 2008 was over an hour long?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Journey's End</span><span class="answer">Journey's End</span><span class="answer">Journey's End</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572801823acd2414000df1ff"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; play?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2010</span><span class="answer">2010</span><span class="answer">2010</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>826 Doctor Who instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes (the most common format), 45-minute episodes (for Resurrection of the Daleks in the 1984 series, a single season in 1985, and the revival), two feature-length productions (1983's The Five Doctors and the 1996 television film), eight Christmas specials (most of 60 minutes' duration, one of 72 minutes), and four additional specials ranging from 60 to 75 minutes in 2009, 2010 and 2013. Four mini-episodes, running about eight minutes each, were also produced for the 1993, 2005 and 2007 Children in Need charity appeals, while another mini-episode was produced in 2008 for a Doctor Who-themed edition of The Proms. The 1993 2-part story, entitled Dimensions in Time, was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera EastEnders and was filmed partly on the EastEnders set. A two-part mini-episode was also produced for the 2011 edition of Comic Relief. Starting with the 2009 special &quot;Planet of the Dead&quot;, the series was filmed in 1080i for HDTV, and broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728023a4b864d19001641f4"><p> <strong class="question">How many Doctor Who episodes have been shown, in total?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">826</span><span class="answer">826</span><span class="answer">826</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728023a4b864d19001641f5"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most common length of Doctor Who episodes?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">25-minute</span><span class="answer">25-minute</span><span class="answer">25-minute</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728023a4b864d19001641f6"><p> <strong class="question">How many Doctor Who Christmas Specials have been shown?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">eight</span><span class="answer">eight</span><span class="answer">eight</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728023a4b864d19001641f7"><p> <strong class="question">How long was the longest Doctor Who Christmas Special?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">72 minutes</span><span class="answer">72 minutes</span><span class="answer">72 minutes</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728023a4b864d19001641f8"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Doctor Who begin being shown in HDTV?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2009</span><span class="answer">2009</span><span class="answer">2009</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Between about 1964 and 1973, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC's various video tape and film libraries were either destroyed,[note 3] wiped, or suffered from poor storage which led to severe deterioration from broadcast quality.

In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's The Five Doctors, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short &quot;Time Crash&quot; alongside David Tennant, and most recently in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors. In addition, the Doctor has occasionally encountered himself in the form of his own incarnation, from the near future or past. The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum (albeit frozen and as an exhibit), the Third Doctor encounters and interacts with himself in the story Day of the Daleks, the Fourth Doctor encounters and interacts with the future incarnation of himself (the 'Watcher') in the story Logopolis, the Ninth Doctor observes a former version of his current incarnation in &quot;Father's Day&quot;, and the Eleventh Doctor briefly comes face to face with himself in &quot;The Big Bang&quot;. In &quot;The Almost People&quot; the Doctor comes face-to-face with himself although it is found out that this incarnation is in fact just a flesh replica. In &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as &quot;his secret&quot; and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57280b2b2ca10214002d9c66"><p> <strong class="question">What Doctor was first referred to as &quot;his secret&quot;?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the War Doctor</span><span class="answer">an unknown incarnation of himself</span><span class="answer">the War Doctor</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57280b2b2ca10214002d9c67"><p> <strong class="question">Which episode featured the return of William Hartnell?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Three Doctors</span><span class="answer">The Three Doctors</span><span class="answer">The Three Doctors</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57280b2b2ca10214002d9c68"><p> <strong class="question">Which Doctor returned for the &quot;Children in Need&quot; show?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Peter Davison</span><span class="answer">Peter Davison</span><span class="answer">Peter Davison</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57280b2b2ca10214002d9c6a"><p> <strong class="question">In which episode does the First Doctor see himself?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Space Museum</span><span class="answer">The Space Museum</span><span class="answer">The Space Museum</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57280b2b2ca10214002d9c69"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the 50th Anniversary episode?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Day of the Doctor</span><span class="answer">The Day of the Doctor</span><span class="answer">The Day of the Doctor</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Additionally, multiple Doctors have returned in new adventures together in audio dramas based on the series.

In The Brain of Morbius (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor may not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted may have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In Mawdryn Undead (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special The Five Doctors, the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms &quot;Fourth&quot;, the First Doctor excitedly replies &quot;Goodness me. So there are five of me now.&quot; In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself &quot;the Eleventh&quot; in &quot;The Lodger&quot;. In the 2013 episode &quot;The Time of the Doctor,&quot; the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied &quot;Fall of the Eleventh&quot; which had been trailed throughout the series.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57280e323acd2414000df349"><p> <strong class="question">In what episode does the &quot;Fall of the Eleventh&quot; happen?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Time of the Doctor</span><span class="answer">The Time of the Doctor</span><span class="answer">The Time of the Doctor</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57280e323acd2414000df34a"><p> <strong class="question">In what episode is it brought up that the First Doctor might not actually be the first Doctor?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Brain of Morbius</span><span class="answer">The Five Doctors</span><span class="answer">The Brain of Morbius</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57280e323acd2414000df34b"><p> <strong class="question">In what episode was the Fifth Doctor confirmed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Mawdryn Undead</span><span class="answer">Mawdryn Undead</span><span class="answer">Mawdryn Undead</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57280e323acd2414000df34c"><p> <strong class="question">In what episode does the Eleventh Doctor first acknowledge his number?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Lodger</span><span class="answer">The Lodger</span><span class="answer">The Time of the Doctor</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57280e323acd2414000df34d"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the 20th Anniversary special aired?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1983</span><span class="answer">1983</span><span class="answer">1983</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The programme's first serial, An Unearthly Child, shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, Susan Foreman.

One of the roles of the companion is to remind the Doctor of his &quot;moral duty&quot;. The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin. Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes — or loves — on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728103eff5b5019007d9c30"><p> <strong class="question">What type of creature is usually Doctor Who's companion?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a human</span><span class="answer">a human</span><span class="answer">usually human, or humanoid aliens</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728103eff5b5019007d9c31"><p> <strong class="question">What is the only story of the original series where Doctor Who travels alone?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Deadly Assassin</span><span class="answer">The Deadly Assassin</span><span class="answer">The Deadly Assassin</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728103eff5b5019007d9c33"><p> <strong class="question">What relative of Doctor Who traveled with him in the early episodes?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">his granddaughter Susan Foreman</span><span class="answer">Susan Foreman</span><span class="answer">his granddaughter</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728103eff5b5019007d9c34"><p> <strong class="question">What was the occupation of Doctor Who's other (non-related) companions?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">teachers</span><span class="answer">to remind the Doctor of his &quot;moral duty&quot;</span><span class="answer">teachers</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728103eff5b5019007d9c32"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the character known as the Time Lady?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Romana</span><span class="answer">Romana</span><span class="answer">Sarah Jane Smith</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Since the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role.

The primary companions of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors were Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) recurring as secondary companion figures. The Eleventh Doctor became the first to travel with a married couple, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), whilst out-of-sync meetings with River Song (Alex Kingston) and Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) provided ongoing story arcs.

The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopi with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon. Their main weakness is their eyestalk; attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to &quot;exterminate&quot; all non-Dalek beings.

The Master was briefly played by Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers until Anthony Ainley took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's hiatus in 1989.

The various parts were built up using musique concrète techniques, by creating tape loops of an individually struck piano string and individual test oscillators and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 (1979–80). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, &quot;Did I write that?&quot;[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572816213acd2414000df429"><p> <strong class="question">Who composed the original Doctor Who theme?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Ron Grainer</span><span class="answer">Ron Grainer</span><span class="answer">Ron Grainer</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572816213acd2414000df42a"><p> <strong class="question">What workshop helped with the creation of the Doctor Who theme?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the BBC Radiophonic Workshop</span><span class="answer">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</span><span class="answer">the BBC Radiophonic Workshop</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572816213acd2414000df42b"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of techniques were used to create the theme?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">musique concrète</span><span class="answer">musique concrète techniques</span><span class="answer">musique concrète techniques</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572816213acd2414000df42c"><p> <strong class="question">When was the last season that this original theme was used?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">17</span><span class="answer">season 17</span><span class="answer">17</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572816213acd2414000df42d"><p> <strong class="question">Upon hearing the final product, what was the creator quoted as saying?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Did I write that?</span><span class="answer">Did I write that?</span><span class="answer">Did I write that?</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A different arrangement was recorded by Peter Howell for season 18 (1980), which was in turn replaced by Dominic Glynn's arrangement for the season-long serial The Trial of a Time Lord in season 23 (1986).

In 1988 the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (later known as The KLF) released the single &quot;Doctorin' the Tardis&quot; under the name The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including &quot;Rock and Roll Part 2&quot; by Gary Glitter (who recorded vocals for some of the CD-single remix versions of &quot;Doctorin' the Tardis&quot;). Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include Orbital, Pink Floyd, the Australian string ensemble Fourplay, New Zealand punk band Blam Blam Blam, The Pogues, Thin Lizzy, Dub Syndicate, and the comedians Bill Bailey and Mitch Benn. Both the theme and obsessive fans were satirised on The Chaser's War on Everything. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs, and has made its way into mobile-phone ringtones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme.

The logo from 1973–80 was used for the Third Doctor's final season and for the majority of the Fourth Doctor's tenure. The following logo, while most associated with the Fifth Doctor, was also used for the Fourth Doctor's final season. The logo used for the Ninth Doctor was slightly edited for the Tenth Doctor, but it retained the same general appearance. The logo used for the Eleventh Doctor had the &quot;DW&quot; TARDIS insignia placed to the right in 2012, but the same font remained, albeit with a slight edit to the texture every episode, with the texture relating to some aspect of the story. The logo for the Twelfth Doctor had the &quot;DW&quot; TARDIS insignia removed and the font was subtly altered, as well as made slightly larger. As of 2014, the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors is the primary logo used on all media and merchandise relating to past Doctors, and the current Doctor Who logo is used for all merchandise relating to the current Doctor.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57281f203acd2414000df4f5"><p> <strong class="question">What logo was modified and reused for the 50th Anniversary special?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The original logo</span><span class="answer">The original logo used for the First Doctor</span><span class="answer">The original logo</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57281f203acd2414000df4f6"><p> <strong class="question">Which logo had the DW Tardis insignia removed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The logo for the Twelfth Doctor</span><span class="answer">The logo for the Twelfth Doctor</span><span class="answer">The logo for the Twelfth Doctor</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57281f203acd2414000df4f7"><p> <strong class="question">What logo is used for all merchandise that features past Doctors?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors</span><span class="answer">the Third and Eighth Doctors</span><span class="answer">the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57281f203acd2414000df4f8"><p> <strong class="question">Which logo was used for the third Doctor Who's last season?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The logo from 1973–80</span><span class="answer">The logo from 1973–80</span><span class="answer">The logo from 1973–80</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57281f203acd2414000df4f9"><p> <strong class="question">Which Doctor was the current Doctor during the 50th Anniversary special?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Eleventh Doctor</span><span class="answer">the Eleventh Doctor</span><span class="answer">the Eleventh</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Premiering the day after the assassination of John F.

Doctor Who has always appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; episodes are now repeated on BBC Three. The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings. The first of these was the &quot;Dalekmania&quot; period (circa 1964–1965), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought Doctor Who ratings of between 9 and 14 million, even for stories which did not feature them. The second was the late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12 million.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57282036ff5b5019007d9d9c"><p> <strong class="question">The first episode of Doctor Who premiered the day after what famous event in history?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the assassination of John F.

Its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time and was, according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme's 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the soap opera Coronation Street, the most popular show at the time. After the series' revival in 2005 (the third notable period of high ratings), it has consistently had high viewership levels for the evening on which the episode is broadcast.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572821ceff5b5019007d9db2"><p> <strong class="question">When was Doctor Who viewing at its highest level?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">During the ITV network strike of 1979</span><span class="answer">During the ITV network strike of 1979</span><span class="answer">1979</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572821ceff5b5019007d9db3"><p> <strong class="question">What was the main reason for the show's suspension in 1989?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers</span><span class="answer">performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor</span><span class="answer">performance</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572821ceff5b5019007d9db4"><p> <strong class="question">Fans blame the poor viewership of the late 80's to competition from what show?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Coronation Street</span><span class="answer">Coronation Street</span><span class="answer">Coronation Street</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572821ceff5b5019007d9db5"><p> <strong class="question">How popular was Coronation Street in the late 80's?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the most popular show at the time</span><span class="answer">the most popular show</span><span class="answer">the most popular show at the time</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572821ceff5b5019007d9db6"><p> <strong class="question">When was the third period of high viewership for the Doctor Who series?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">After the series' revival in 2005</span><span class="answer">the series' revival in 2005</span><span class="answer">2005</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Only four episodes have ever had their premiere showings on channels other than BBC One.

For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks (better known for playing Cybermen) played the Doctor.

The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006. John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode &quot;The Unquiet Dead&quot;, and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in &quot;Aliens of London&quot;. A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London. A fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572829532ca10214002d9fa2"><p> <strong class="question">What Doctor Who spin-off series was commissioned by the BBC?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Torchwood</span><span class="answer">Torchwood</span><span class="answer">Torchwood</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572829532ca10214002d9fa3"><p> <strong class="question">When did Torchwood premier?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">22 October 2006</span><span class="answer">22 October 2006</span><span class="answer">22 October 2006</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572829532ca10214002d9fa4"><p> <strong class="question">When did the second series of Torchwood play?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2008</span><span class="answer">2008</span><span class="answer">2008</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572829532ca10214002d9fa5"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the story from the third Torchwood series?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Children of Earth</span><span class="answer">Children of Earth</span><span class="answer">Children of Earth</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572829532ca10214002d9fa6"><p> <strong class="question">Was is the name of the Torchwood series that was mostly based in the US?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Torchwood: Miracle Day</span><span class="answer">Torchwood: Miracle Day</span><span class="answer">Torchwood: Miracle Day</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Sarah Jane Adventures, starring Elisabeth Sladen who reprised her role as investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, was developed by CBBC; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007.
