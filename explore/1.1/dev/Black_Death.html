From there, it was most likely carried by Oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships. Spreading throughout the Mediterranean and Europe, the Black Death is estimated to have killed 30–60% of Europe's total population. In total, the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350–375 million in the 14th century. The world population as a whole did not recover to pre-plague levels until the 17th century. The plague recurred occasionally in Europe until the 19th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264684708984140094c123"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the black death originate?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the arid plains of Central Asia</span><span class="answer">Central Asia</span><span class="answer">Central Asia</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264684708984140094c124"><p> <strong class="question">How did the black death make it to the Mediterranean and Europe?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">merchant ships.</span><span class="answer">merchant ships</span><span class="answer">Silk Road</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264684708984140094c125"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the European population did the black death kill?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">30–60% of Europe's total population</span><span class="answer">30–60% of Europe's total population</span><span class="answer">30–60%</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264684708984140094c126"><p> <strong class="question">When did the world's population finally recover from the black death?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the 17th century</span><span class="answer">17th century</span><span class="answer">17th century</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264684708984140094c127"><p> <strong class="question">For how long did the plague stick around?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">until the 19th century</span><span class="answer">until the 19th century</span><span class="answer">19th century</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The plague disease, caused by Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda. Nestorian graves dating to 1338–39 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India. In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China. In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century. In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after. Epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it reached Constantinople in 1347.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572647935951b619008f6ec9"><p> <strong class="question">What does it mean for a disease to be enzootic?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">commonly present</span><span class="answer">commonly present</span><span class="answer">commonly present</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572647935951b619008f6eca"><p> <strong class="question">How old are the gravestones that reference the plague?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">dating to 1338–39</span><span class="answer">1338–39</span><span class="answer">1338–39</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572647935951b619008f6ecb"><p> <strong class="question">Where do scientists think all of the plagues originated from?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">China</span><span class="answer">China</span><span class="answer">China</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572647935951b619008f6ecc"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Chinese famine begin?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1331</span><span class="answer">1331</span><span class="answer">1331</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572647935951b619008f6ecd"><p> <strong class="question">How many did this epidemic in China kill?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">an estimated 25 million</span><span class="answer">25 million</span><span class="answer">25 million</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via Genoese traders at the port city of Kaffa in the Crimea in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering from the disease, the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread north. Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264845f1498d1400e8db0a"><p> <strong class="question">Who introduced plague to Europe?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Genoese traders</span><span class="answer">Genoese traders</span><span class="answer">Genoese traders</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264845f1498d1400e8db0b"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the army siege belong to?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Jani Beg</span><span class="answer">Jani Beg</span><span class="answer">Jani Beg</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264845f1498d1400e8db0c"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Mongol army throw in their catapults?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">infected corpses</span><span class="answer">infected corpses</span><span class="answer">infected corpses</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264845f1498d1400e8db0d"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the genoese traders bring the plague?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Sicily</span><span class="answer">Sicily and the south of Europe</span><span class="answer">Sicily</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264845f1498d1400e8db0e"><p> <strong class="question">What contributed to the severity of the plague?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">war, famine, and weather</span><span class="answer">war, famine, and weather</span><span class="answer">war, famine, and weather</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>From Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350.

During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to Gaza, and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, including Ashkelon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon, Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo. In 1348–49, the disease reached Antioch. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264991f1498d1400e8db2e"><p> <strong class="question">What effect did the plague have on the Middle East?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures</span><span class="answer">depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures</span><span class="answer">depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264991f1498d1400e8db2f"><p> <strong class="question">When had the plague reached Alexandria?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">autumn 1347</span><span class="answer">1347</span><span class="answer">1347</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264991f1498d1400e8db30"><p> <strong class="question">How did the plague infiltrate Alexandria?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">y through the port's trade with Constantinople, and ports on the Black Sea</span><span class="answer">port's trade</span><span class="answer">trade with Constantinople</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264991f1498d1400e8db31"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the residents of Antioch flee to?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The city's residents fled to the north</span><span class="answer">the north</span><span class="answer">north</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Gasquet (1908) claimed that the Latin name atra mors (Black Death) for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in modern times in 1631 in a book on Danish history by J.I.

This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory. Today, this is known as the Miasma theory.

The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis. The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264c42dd62a815002e80c6"><p> <strong class="question">What was considered responsible for the black death as well as the epidemic in southern China?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Yersinia pestis</span><span class="answer">Yersinia pestis</span><span class="answer">Yersinia pestis</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264c42dd62a815002e80c7"><p> <strong class="question">Where and when did the investigation of the plague pathogen begin?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Hong Kong in 1894</span><span class="answer">Hong Kong</span><span class="answer">Hong Kong in 1894</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264c42dd62a815002e80c8"><p> <strong class="question">Who was yersinia pestis named for?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin</span><span class="answer">Alexandre Yersin</span><span class="answer">Alexandre Yersin</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264c42dd62a815002e80c9"><p> <strong class="question">What did Paul-Louis Simond establish in 1898?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted</span><span class="answer">mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted</span><span class="answer">The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264c42dd62a815002e80ca"><p> <strong class="question">What was the bubonic plague mechanism reliant on?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">two populations of rodents</span><span class="answer">two populations of rodents</span><span class="answer">two populations of rodents</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The historian Francis Aidan Gasquet wrote about the 'Great Pestilence' in 1893 and suggested that &quot;it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague&quot;.

Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free flowing and bright red. Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264d58f1498d1400e8db7a"><p> <strong class="question">What is the mortality rate of the modern bubonic plague?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">30–75%</span><span class="answer">30–75%</span><span class="answer">30–75%</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264d58f1498d1400e8db7b"><p> <strong class="question">How high do plague fevers run?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">100–106 °F</span><span class="answer">38–41 °C</span><span class="answer">41 °C</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264d58f1498d1400e8db7c"><p> <strong class="question">What percent of untreated victims of the plague die within 8 days?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">80 percent</span><span class="answer">80</span><span class="answer">80</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264d58f1498d1400e8db7d"><p> <strong class="question">What is the mortality rate of pneumonic plague?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">90 to 95 percent</span><span class="answer">90 to 95</span><span class="answer">90 to 95 percent</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57264d58f1498d1400e8db7e"><p> <strong class="question">What skin-related symptom appears from the pneumonic plague?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">purple skin patches</span><span class="answer">purple skin patches</span><span class="answer">purple skin patches</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In October 2010, the open-access scientific journal PLoS Pathogens published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of Yersinia pestis in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt and Raoult in 1998.

Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57265285708984140094c25b"><p> <strong class="question">Why might rats not be responsible for the plague?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the rat population was insufficient</span><span class="answer">rat population was insufficient</span><span class="answer">rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57265285708984140094c25c"><p> <strong class="question">How significant was the transfer of disease through fleas?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">of marginal significance</span><span class="answer">marginal</span><span class="answer">marginal</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57265285708984140094c25d"><p> <strong class="question">Why  might the temperature affect the theory of plague spreading?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas</span><span class="answer">too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas</span><span class="answer">too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57265285708984140094c25e"><p> <strong class="question">Was the bubonic plague spread faster or slower than modern bubonic plague?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague</span><span class="answer">faster</span><span class="answer">faster</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57265285708984140094c25f"><p> <strong class="question">How many years could separate outbreaks of the black death?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">5 to 15 years</span><span class="answer">5 to 15</span><span class="answer">5 to 15</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A variety of alternatives to the Y. pestis have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of &quot;blood poisoning&quot;) and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726534d708984140094c26d"><p> <strong class="question">What does Graham Twigg propose about the spread of disease?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a form of anthrax</span><span class="answer">was a form of anthrax</span><span class="answer">the cause was a form of anthrax</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726534d708984140094c26e"><p> <strong class="question">What was Norman Cantor's theory about the plague?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a combination of anthrax and other pandemics</span><span class="answer">a combination of anthrax and other pandemics</span><span class="answer">a combination of anthrax and other pandemics</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726534d708984140094c26f"><p> <strong class="question">Which diseases do many scientists believe contributed to plague pandemic?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections</span><span class="answer">typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections</span><span class="answer">typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726534d708984140094c270"><p> <strong class="question">What is septicemia? </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">(a type of &quot;blood poisoning&quot;</span><span class="answer">a type of &quot;blood poisoning&quot;</span><span class="answer">a type of &quot;blood poisoning&quot;</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726534d708984140094c271"><p> <strong class="question">How many bodies did Public Health England exhume? </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">25</span><span class="answer">25</span><span class="answer">25</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third. The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypt's population. Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110–120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726542ff1498d1400e8dc28"><p> <strong class="question">How much of the population in the Middle East died of the plague?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">about a third.</span><span class="answer">about a third</span><span class="answer">about a third</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726542ff1498d1400e8dc29"><p> <strong class="question">How much of Paris' population was killed by the plague?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people</span><span class="answer">100,000</span><span class="answer">Half</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726542ff1498d1400e8dc2a"><p> <strong class="question">What do isolated, spaced out graves of plague victims indicate?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">at least some pre-planning and Christian burials</span><span class="answer">some pre-planning and Christian burials</span><span class="answer">some pre-planning and Christian burials</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726542ff1498d1400e8dc2b"><p> <strong class="question">How many people would die of plague in largely populated cities?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">as much as 50%</span><span class="answer">50%</span><span class="answer">50%</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726542ff1498d1400e8dc2c"><p> <strong class="question">Which areas were least vulnerable to disease?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">most isolated areas</span><span class="answer">isolated areas</span><span class="answer">isolated</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries.

Plague was present in at least one location in the Islamic world virtually every year between 1500 and 1850. Plague repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost 30 to 50 thousand inhabitants to it in 1620–21, and again in 1654–57, 1665, 1691, and 1740–42. Plague remained a major event in Ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century. Between 1701 and 1750, thirty-seven larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in Constantinople, and an additional thirty-one between 1751 and 1800. Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague, and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726577f708984140094c301"><p> <strong class="question">During which years was the plague present in Islamic countries?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">between 1500 and 1850</span><span class="answer">1500 and 1850</span><span class="answer">1500 and 1850</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726577f708984140094c302"><p> <strong class="question">How many people were lost in Algiers during 1620-21?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">30 to 50 thousand inhabitants</span><span class="answer">30 to 50 thousand</span><span class="answer">30 to 50 thousand</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726577f708984140094c303"><p> <strong class="question">How long did plague last in the Ottoman empire?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">until the second quarter of the 19th century.</span><span class="answer">until the second quarter of the 19th century</span><span class="answer">until the second quarter of the 19th century</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726577f708984140094c304"><p> <strong class="question">How many people, at most, have died of plague in Baghdad? </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">two-thirds of its population</span><span class="answer">two-thirds of its population</span><span class="answer">two-thirds of its population</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/evaluate.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/model.js"></script></body></html>
