The war was fought between the colonies of British America and New France, with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as Native American allies. At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. Long in conflict, the metropole nations declared war on each other in 1756, escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733cf61d058e614000b62e9"><p> <strong class="question">When was the French and Indian War?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1754–1763</span><span class="answer">1754–1763</span><span class="answer">1754–1763</span><span class="answer">1754–1763</span><span class="answer">1754–1763</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733cf61d058e614000b62ea"><p> <strong class="question">Who fought in the French and Indian war?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">colonies of British America and New France</span><span class="answer">colonies of British America and New France</span><span class="answer">British America and New France</span><span class="answer">British America and New France</span><span class="answer">the colonies of British America and New France</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733cf61d058e614000b62eb"><p> <strong class="question">How many people were in French North American Colonies?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">roughly 60,000 European settlers</span><span class="answer">60,000</span><span class="answer">60,000</span><span class="answer">60,000</span><span class="answer">60,000 European settlers</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733cf61d058e614000b62ec"><p> <strong class="question">How many people were in British North American Colonies?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2 million</span><span class="answer">2 million</span><span class="answer">2 million</span><span class="answer">2 million</span><span class="answer">2 million</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The war was fought primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies, from Virginia in the South to Nova Scotia in the North.

None succeeded and the main effort by Braddock was a disaster; he was defeated in the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9, 1755 and died a few days later. British operations in 1755, 1756 and 1757 in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York all failed, due to a combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies. In 1755, the British captured Fort Beauséjour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia; soon afterward they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians. Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley, Commander-in-Chief, North America, without direction from Great Britain. The Acadians, both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty, were expelled. Native Americans were likewise driven off their land to make way for settlers from New England.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733d13e4776f419006612c4"><p> <strong class="question">When did colonial governors meet with General Edward Braddock about attack on the french?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1755</span><span class="answer">1755</span><span class="answer">1755</span><span class="answer">1755</span><span class="answer">1755</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733d13e4776f419006612c5"><p> <strong class="question">How successful was initial effort by Braddock?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">disaster; he was defeated in the Battle of the Monongahela</span><span class="answer">disaster</span><span class="answer">was a disaster</span><span class="answer">he was defeated</span><span class="answer">None succeeded</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733d13e4776f419006612c6"><p> <strong class="question">Why did British operation fail in 1755, 56, 57?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies</span><span class="answer">poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies</span><span class="answer">a combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies</span><span class="answer">poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts</span><span class="answer">a combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733d13e4776f419006612c7"><p> <strong class="question">In 1755 what fort did British capture?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Fort Beauséjour</span><span class="answer">Fort Beauséjour</span><span class="answer">Fort Beauséjour</span><span class="answer">Fort Beauséjour</span><span class="answer">Fort Beauséjour</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733d13e4776f419006612c8"><p> <strong class="question">What order did British make of French?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">expulsion of the Acadians</span><span class="answer">expulsion of the Acadians</span><span class="answer">deportation</span><span class="answer">expulsion</span><span class="answer">deportation</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>After the disastrous 1757 British campaigns (resulting in a failed expedition against Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry, which was followed by Indian torture and massacres of British victims), the British government fell.

In British America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War. As there had already been a King George's War in the 1740s, British colonists named the second war in King George's reign after their opponents, and it became known as the French and Indian War. This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States, but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict, and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain. American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years' War.

When war broke out, the French used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region (an area not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British), including the Huron, Mississauga, Ojibwa, Winnebago, and Potawatomi. The British were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee – until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. In 1758 the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton, in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict. It was not uncommon for small bands to participate on the &quot;other side&quot; of the conflict from formally negotiated agreements, as most tribes were decentralized and bands made their own decisions about warfare.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733da01d058e614000b63f9"><p> <strong class="question">What are the Siouan-speaking tribes?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Catawba, Muskogee-speaking Creek and Choctaw</span><span class="answer">Catawba</span><span class="answer">Catawba</span><span class="answer">Catawba</span><span class="answer">Catawba</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733da01d058e614000b63fa"><p> <strong class="question">What areas did French recruit natives from?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">western portions of the Great Lakes region</span><span class="answer">Great Lakes</span><span class="answer">tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region</span><span class="answer">western portions of the Great Lakes</span><span class="answer">western portions of the Great Lakes region</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733da01d058e614000b63fb"><p> <strong class="question">What tribes supported British?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee</span><span class="answer">Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee</span><span class="answer">Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee</span><span class="answer">Iroquois</span><span class="answer">the Iroquois Six Nations</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the start of the war, no French regular army troops were stationed in North America, and few British troops.

In 1750 Christopher Gist, acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company, explored the Ohio territory and opened negotiations with the Indian tribes at Logstown. He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians, through their &quot;Half-King&quot; Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative, agreed to terms that included permission to build a &quot;strong house&quot; at the mouth of the Monongahela River (the site of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).

His permanent replacement, the Marquis Duquesne, did not arrive in New France until 1752 to take over the post. The continuing British activity in the Ohio territories prompted Longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade, an officer in the Troupes de la Marine. Langlade was given 300 men, including French-Canadians and warriors of the Ottawa. His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following Céloron's orders to cease trading with the British. On June 21, the French war party attacked the trading centre at Pickawillany, capturing three traders and killing 14 people of the Miami nation, including Old Briton.

His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British. Marin followed the route that Céloron had mapped out four years earlier, but where Céloron had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates, Marin constructed and garrisoned forts. He first constructed Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania) on Lake Erie's south shore. He had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. Marin constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania), designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson, a chief of the Mingo, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion. He intensely disliked the French (whom he accused of killing and eating his father). Traveling to Fort Le Boeuf, he threatened the French with military action, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733ea04d058e614000b6594"><p> <strong class="question">Who took command of French in spring of 1753?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Paul Marin de la Malgue</span><span class="answer">Paul Marin de la Malgue</span><span class="answer">Paul Marin de la Malgue</span><span class="answer">Paul Marin de la Malgue</span><span class="answer">Paul Marin de la Malgue</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733ea04d058e614000b6595"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Marin build first fort?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania</span><span class="answer">Fort Presque Isle</span><span class="answer">near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania</span><span class="answer">Fort Presque Isle</span><span class="answer">near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733ea04d058e614000b6596"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Marin's second fort constructed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania</span><span class="answer">Fort Le Boeuf</span><span class="answer">present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania</span><span class="answer">Fort Le Boeuf</span><span class="answer">present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733ea04d058e614000b6597"><p> <strong class="question">What was Marin's orders?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British</span><span class="answer">protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British</span><span class="answer">to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British</span><span class="answer">protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley</span><span class="answer">he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733ea04d058e614000b6598"><p> <strong class="question">What native chief travelled to French fort and threatened Marin?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Tanaghrisson</span><span class="answer">Tanaghrisson</span><span class="answer">Tanaghrisson</span><span class="answer">Tanaghrisson</span><span class="answer">the Mingo</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Iroquois sent runners to the manor of William Johnson in upstate New York.

Nevertheless, the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733f5264776f419006615a3"><p> <strong class="question">What political response was convening in June/July 1754?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Albany Congress</span><span class="answer">Albany Congress</span><span class="answer">the opening of hostilities</span><span class="answer">Albany Congress</span><span class="answer">Albany Congress</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733f5264776f419006615a4"><p> <strong class="question">What was the goal of congress?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians, since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal</span><span class="answer">formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians</span><span class="answer">formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians</span><span class="answer">unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians</span><span class="answer">to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733f5264776f419006615a5"><p> <strong class="question">Was the plan formalized?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown</span><span class="answer">was never ratified</span><span class="answer">never ratified</span><span class="answer">never ratified</span><span class="answer">The plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733f5264776f419006615a6"><p> <strong class="question">What was the importance of the congress?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence</span><span class="answer">became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence</span><span class="answer">became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence</span><span class="answer">prototype for confederation</span><span class="answer">became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Braddock (with George Washington as one of his aides) led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne.

When Johnson was seen as the larger threat, Vaudreuil sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric to meet that threat. Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River, but Johnson had strongly fortified it, and Dieskau's Indian support was reluctant to attack. The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry. The battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field. Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point, where they began the construction of Fort Carillon (later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733f8dc4776f419006615f7"><p> <strong class="question">Who was New France's governor?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Marquis de Vaudreuil.</span><span class="answer">Marquis de Vaudreuil</span><span class="answer">the Marquis de Vaudreuil</span><span class="answer">Marquis de Vaudreuil</span><span class="answer">Marquis de Vaudreuil</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733f8dc4776f419006615f8"><p> <strong class="question">How did Vaudreuil react when Johnson was seen as larger threat?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric to meet that threat</span><span class="answer">sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric</span><span class="answer">sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric</span><span class="answer">sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric</span><span class="answer">sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733f8dc4776f419006615f9"><p> <strong class="question">Who won the battle of Lake George?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field</span><span class="answer">The battle ended inconclusively</span><span class="answer">ended inconclusively</span><span class="answer">both sides withdrawing from the field</span><span class="answer">The battle ended inconclusively</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733f8dc4776f419006615fa"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Johnson stop?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Fort William Henry</span><span class="answer">Fort William Henry</span><span class="answer">Fort William Henry</span><span class="answer">Fort William Henry</span><span class="answer">Fort William Henry</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733f8dc4776f419006615fb"><p> <strong class="question">Where was French withdrawal to?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Ticonderoga Point,</span><span class="answer">Ticonderoga Point</span><span class="answer">Ticonderoga Point</span><span class="answer">Ticonderoga Point</span><span class="answer">Ticonderoga Point</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Colonel Monckton, in the sole British success that year, captured Fort Beauséjour in June 1755, cutting the French fortress at Louisbourg off from land-based reinforcements. To cut vital supplies to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia's Governor Charles Lawrence ordered the deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area. Monckton's forces, including companies of Rogers' Rangers, forcibly removed thousands of Acadians, chasing down many who resisted, and sometimes committing atrocities. More than any other factor, the cutting off of supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise. The Acadian resistance, in concert with native allies, including the Mi'kmaq, was sometimes quite stiff, with ongoing frontier raids (against Dartmouth and Lunenburg among others). Other than the campaigns to expel the Acadians (ranging around the Bay of Fundy, on the Petitcodiac and St. John rivers, and Île Saint-Jean), the only clashes of any size were at Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733f9fa4776f4190066161f"><p> <strong class="question">Who captured Fort Beausejour?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Colonel Monckton</span><span class="answer">Colonel Monckton</span><span class="answer">Colonel Monckton</span><span class="answer">Colonel Monckton</span><span class="answer">British</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733f9fa4776f41900661620"><p> <strong class="question">How were British able to cut supplies to Louisbourg?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area.</span><span class="answer">deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area</span><span class="answer">captured Fort Beauséjour</span><span class="answer">captured Fort Beauséjour</span><span class="answer">the deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733f9fa4776f41900661621"><p> <strong class="question">What other clashes were involved in taking Louisbourg?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757</span><span class="answer">Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757</span><span class="answer">deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area</span><span class="answer">Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek</span><span class="answer">Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the death of Braddock, William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America.

In the March Battle of Fort Bull, French forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies, including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder. They set back any British hopes for campaigns on Lake Ontario, and endangered the Oswego garrison, already short on supplies.

The Europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the Indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables, which angered the Indians.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733fd66d058e614000b6735"><p> <strong class="question">Who refused to act until Loudoun approved plans?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Abercrombie</span><span class="answer">Abercrombie</span><span class="answer">Abercrombie</span><span class="answer">Abercrombie</span><span class="answer">Abercrombie</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733fd66d058e614000b6736"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Montcalm move his heaquarter to show strategic advancement?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Ticonderoga</span><span class="answer">Ticonderoga</span><span class="answer">Ticonderoga</span><span class="answer">Ticonderoga</span><span class="answer">Ticonderoga</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733fd66d058e614000b6737"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Moncalm slip away to attack, left largely unprotected?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Oswego</span><span class="answer">Oswego</span><span class="answer">Oswego</span><span class="answer">Oswego</span><span class="answer">Oswego</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733fd66d058e614000b6738"><p> <strong class="question">What disagreement did Montcalm and Indians have?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">disposition of prisoners' personal effects</span><span class="answer">the disposition of prisoners' personal effects</span><span class="answer">about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects</span><span class="answer">disposition of prisoners' personal effects</span><span class="answer">the disposition of prisoners' personal effects</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Loudoun, a capable administrator but a cautious field commander, planned one major operation for 1757: an attack on New France's capital, Quebec. Leaving a sizable force at Fort William Henry to distract Montcalm, he began organizing for the expedition to Quebec. He was then ordered by William Pitt, the Secretary of State responsible for the colonies, to attack Louisbourg first. Beset by delays of all kinds, the expedition was finally ready to sail from Halifax, Nova Scotia in early August. In the meantime French ships had escaped the British blockade of the French coast, and a fleet outnumbering the British one awaited Loudoun at Louisbourg. Faced with this strength, Loudoun returned to New York amid news that a massacre had occurred at Fort William Henry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733fe73d058e614000b673d"><p> <strong class="question">What was Loudoun's plans for 1757?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">attack on New France's capital, Quebec</span><span class="answer">an attack on New France's capital, Quebec</span><span class="answer">an attack on New France's capital, Quebec</span><span class="answer">one major operation</span><span class="answer">an attack on New France's capital, Quebec</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733fe73d058e614000b673e"><p> <strong class="question">What was the purpose of Loudoun's troops at Fort Henry?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">to distract Montcalm</span><span class="answer">distract Montcalm</span><span class="answer">distract Montcalm</span><span class="answer">distract Montcalm</span><span class="answer">to distract Montcalm</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733fe73d058e614000b673f"><p> <strong class="question">Who ordered Loudoun to attack Louisbourg?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">William Pitt</span><span class="answer">William Pitt</span><span class="answer">William Pitt</span><span class="answer">William Pitt</span><span class="answer">William Pitt</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733fe73d058e614000b6740"><p> <strong class="question">Given the strength of French forces at Louisbourg, what did Loudoun do?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">returned to New York amid news that a massacre had occurred at Fort William Henry.</span><span class="answer">returned to New York</span><span class="answer">returned to New York</span><span class="answer">returned to New York</span><span class="answer">returned to New York</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>French irregular forces (Canadian scouts and Indians) harassed Fort William Henry throughout the first half of 1757. In January they ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga. In February they launched a daring raid against the position across the frozen Lake George, destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification. In early August, Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort, which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole. When the withdrawal began, some of Montcalm's Indian allies, angered at the lost opportunity for loot, attacked the British column, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves. The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations; as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward having been exposed to European carriers.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733ffa7d058e614000b674f"><p> <strong class="question">What troops attacked Fort William Henry in early 1757?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">French irregular forces (Canadian scouts and Indians)</span><span class="answer">French irregular forces</span><span class="answer">French irregular forces</span><span class="answer">French irregular forces</span><span class="answer">French irregular forces</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733ffa7d058e614000b6750"><p> <strong class="question">On what lake did troops attack fort willima henry in winter?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Lake George</span><span class="answer">Lake George</span><span class="answer">Lake George</span><span class="answer">Lake George</span><span class="answer">Lake George</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5733ffa7d058e614000b6751"><p> <strong class="question">During withdrawal from Fort William Henry, what did some Indian allies of French do?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">attacked the British column, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves.</span><span class="answer">attacked the British column</span><span class="answer">attacked the British column</span><span class="answer">attacked the British</span><span class="answer">attacked the British column</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Vaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758, as the British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping. The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. While many parties to the conflict blamed others (the Indians blamed the French for bringing &quot;bad medicine&quot; as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry), the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle. Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg, while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340111d058e614000b677d"><p> <strong class="question">What was causing New France to have issues with resupplying?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping.</span><span class="answer">British blockade of the French coastline</span><span class="answer">British blockade of the French coastline</span><span class="answer">British blockade of the French coastline</span><span class="answer">British blockade</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340111d058e614000b677e"><p> <strong class="question">What other reason caused poor supply of New France from a difficult winter?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">poor harvest</span><span class="answer">allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot</span><span class="answer">poor harvest in 1757</span><span class="answer">poor harvest in 1757</span><span class="answer">a poor harvest</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340111d058e614000b677f"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Montcalm focusing the defense for New France?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg,</span><span class="answer">St. Lawrence</span><span class="answer">St. Lawrence</span><span class="answer">St. Lawrence</span><span class="answer">the defense of the St. Lawrence</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The British failures in North America, combined with other failures in the European theater, led to the fall from power of Newcastle and his principal military advisor, the Duke of Cumberland.

The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which had been occupied by the British. France chose to cede the former, but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area. They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent. The contemporaneous French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow. The British, for their part, were happy to take New France, as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue and also because they already had ample places from which to obtain sugar. Spain, which traded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba, also gained Louisiana, including New Orleans, from France in compensation for its losses. Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573408ef4776f41900661757"><p> <strong class="question">When did the North American French and Indian War end?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763</span><span class="answer">10 February 1763</span><span class="answer">10 February 1763</span><span class="answer">10 February 1763</span><span class="answer">10 February 1763</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573408ef4776f41900661758"><p> <strong class="question">When was the European portion of the Seven Years War complete?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763</span><span class="answer">15 February 1763</span><span class="answer">15 February 1763</span><span class="answer">15 February 1763</span><span class="answer">15 February 1763</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573408ef4776f41900661759"><p> <strong class="question">What choice did French have for surrendering land?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique</span><span class="answer">surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique</span><span class="answer">either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique,</span><span class="answer">its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands</span><span class="answer">surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573408ef4776f4190066175a"><p> <strong class="question">Why did France choose to give up continental lands?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent</span><span class="answer">They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent</span><span class="answer">They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater</span><span class="answer">value of the Caribbean islands' sugar</span><span class="answer">They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Britain gained control of French Canada and Acadia, colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French-speaking Roman Catholic residents. The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 resulted in land made available to migrants from Europe and the colonies further south. The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces, but many went to France, and some went to New Orleans, which they had expected to remain French. Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands; these latter efforts were unsuccessful. Others migrated to places like Saint-Domingue, and fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution. The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population. (The French word &quot;Acadien&quot; evolved to &quot;Cadien&quot;, then to &quot;Cajun&quot;.)</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340a094776f4190066177d"><p> <strong class="question">How many French colonists were gained by British?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">80,000</span><span class="answer">80,000</span><span class="answer">80,000</span><span class="answer">80,000</span><span class="answer">80,000</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340a094776f4190066177e"><p> <strong class="question">When was the deportation of Acadians?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1755</span><span class="answer">1755</span><span class="answer">1755</span><span class="answer">1755</span><span class="answer">1755</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340a094776f4190066177f"><p> <strong class="question">Where did British resettle many Acadians?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">throughout its North American provinces</span><span class="answer">throughout its North American provinces</span><span class="answer">North American provinces</span><span class="answer">North American provinces</span><span class="answer">its North American provinces</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340a094776f41900661780"><p> <strong class="question">Although some Acadians went to France and other destiantions, what North American city did many move to?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">New Orleans</span><span class="answer">New Orleans</span><span class="answer">New Orleans</span><span class="answer">New Orleans</span><span class="answer">New Orleans</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the treaty, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7, 1763, which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population, a demarcation that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers. The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians. When accommodations were made in the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other issues, religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of &quot;popery&quot;; the Act maintained French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code soon to be removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340b1bd058e614000b6869"><p> <strong class="question">Who issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">King George III</span><span class="answer">King George III</span><span class="answer">King George III</span><span class="answer">King George III</span><span class="answer">King George III</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340b1bd058e614000b686a"><p> <strong class="question">What was the objective of Royal Proclamation of 1763?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory</span><span class="answer">outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory</span><span class="answer">division and administration of the newly conquered territory</span><span class="answer">division and administration</span><span class="answer">the division and administration of the newly conquered territory</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340b1bd058e614000b686b"><p> <strong class="question">What lands were reserved for natives?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">west of the Appalachian Mountains</span><span class="answer">lands west of the Appalachian Mountains</span><span class="answer">west of the Appalachian Mountains</span><span class="answer">west of the Appalachian Mountains</span><span class="answer">west of the Appalachian Mountains</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>For many native populations, the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession. The Ohio Country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement due to the construction of military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes. Although the Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory (which was not completed until 1769) had modest repercussions, the British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the British, and a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies whose divisions the British at times exploited. The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave. Most went to Cuba, including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine, although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340d124776f419006617c3"><p> <strong class="question">Where did many Spanish Catholic move after British takeover in Florida?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Most went to Cuba,</span><span class="answer">Most went to Cuba</span><span class="answer">Cuba</span><span class="answer">Cuba</span><span class="answer">Cuba</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340d124776f419006617c0"><p> <strong class="question">What made Ohio Country vulnerable?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes</span><span class="answer">construction of military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes</span><span class="answer">the construction of military roads to the area</span><span class="answer">military roads to the area</span><span class="answer">the construction of military roads</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340d124776f419006617c1"><p> <strong class="question">When was Spanish takeover of Louisiana Territory complete?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1769</span><span class="answer">1769</span><span class="answer">1769</span><span class="answer">1769</span><span class="answer">1769</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340d124776f419006617c2"><p> <strong class="question">What natives were displaced by British takeover in Florida?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Choctaw and the Creek</span><span class="answer">tribes that did not want to do business with the British</span><span class="answer">Choctaw and the Creek</span><span class="answer">Choctaw and the Creek</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57340d124776f419006617bf"><p> <strong class="question">What did the loss mean to France?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession</span><span class="answer">disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion</span><span class="answer">elimination of French power</span><span class="answer">.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/evaluate.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/model.js"></script></body></html>
