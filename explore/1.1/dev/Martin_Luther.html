Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Late Medieval Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money. He proposed an academic discussion of the power and usefulness of indulgences in his Ninety-Five Theses of 1517. His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7c651aef2371900625bf5"><p> <strong class="question">Of what nationality was Martin Luther?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">German</span><span class="answer">German</span><span class="answer">German</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7c651aef2371900625bf6"><p> <strong class="question">When did Martin Luther die?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">18 February 1546</span><span class="answer">1546</span><span class="answer">1546</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7c651aef2371900625bf7"><p> <strong class="question">What organization's teaching did Luther reject?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Catholic Church.</span><span class="answer">Late Medieval Catholic Church</span><span class="answer">Late Medieval Catholic Church</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7c651aef2371900625bf8"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Church claim could be avoided with money?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">God's punishment</span><span class="answer">God's punishment for sin</span><span class="answer">God's punishment</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7c651aef2371900625bf9"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Church do when Luther refused to retract his writings?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">excommunication</span><span class="answer">excommunication</span><span class="answer">excommunication</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther taught that salvation and subsequently eternal life is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin.

He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours. His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484, where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council. The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther's mother as a hard-working woman of &quot;trading-class stock and middling means&quot; and notes that Luther's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant. He had several brothers and sisters, and is known to have been close to one of them, Jacob. Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family, and he was determined to see Martin, his eldest son, become a lawyer. He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld, then Magdeburg in 1497, where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life, and Eisenach in 1498. The three schools focused on the so-called &quot;trivium&quot;: grammar, rhetoric, and logic. Luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7cdc2a6d7ea1400e1728e"><p> <strong class="question">When was Martin Luther born?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">10 November 1483</span><span class="answer">10 November 1483</span><span class="answer">10 November 1483</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7cdc2a6d7ea1400e1728f"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Luther born?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Eisleben, Saxony</span><span class="answer">Eisleben, Saxony</span><span class="answer">Eisleben, Saxony</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7cdc2a6d7ea1400e17290"><p> <strong class="question">Of what region was Saxony a part?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Holy Roman Empire</span><span class="answer">Holy Roman Empire</span><span class="answer">Holy Roman Empire.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7cdc2a6d7ea1400e17291"><p> <strong class="question">Into what religion was Martin Luther baptized?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Catholic</span><span class="answer">Catholic</span><span class="answer">Catholic</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7cdc2a6d7ea1400e17292"><p> <strong class="question">What profession did Martin's father want his son to pursue?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">lawyer</span><span class="answer">lawyer</span><span class="answer">lawyer</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1501, at the age of 19, he entered the University of Erfurt, which he later described as a beerhouse and whorehouse.

Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience. Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason. For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation, he believed, and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7eba8a6d7ea1400e172cd"><p> <strong class="question">What educational study did Luther start to pursue and immediately  drop?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">law</span><span class="answer">law</span><span class="answer">law</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7eba8a6d7ea1400e172ce"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther think the study of law meant?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">uncertainty</span><span class="answer">uncertainty</span><span class="answer">uncertainty</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7eba8a6d7ea1400e172cf"><p> <strong class="question">What fields of study did Martin Luther prefer?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">theology and philosophy</span><span class="answer">theology and philosophy</span><span class="answer">theology and philosophy</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7eba8a6d7ea1400e172d0"><p> <strong class="question">How did Luther's tutors advise him to test what he learned?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">by experience</span><span class="answer">by experience</span><span class="answer">experience</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f7eba8a6d7ea1400e172d1"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther think reason could not be used to test?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">God</span><span class="answer">God</span><span class="answer">God</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>He later attributed his decision to an event: on 2 July 1505, he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home.

Luther himself seemed saddened by the move. Those who attended a farewell supper walked him to the door of the Black Cloister. &quot;This day you see me, and then, not ever again,&quot; he said.

As he studied these portions of the Bible, he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways. He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity. The most important for Luther was the doctrine of justification – God's act of declaring a sinner righteous – by faith alone through God's grace. He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God's grace, attainable only through faith in Jesus as the Messiah. &quot;This one and firm rock, which we call the doctrine of justification,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine, which comprehends the understanding of all godliness.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f80ad1a6d7ea1400e1739b"><p> <strong class="question">What did Martin Luther do during 1510 to 1520?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">lectured</span><span class="answer">lectured on the Psalms</span><span class="answer">lectured</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f80ad1a6d7ea1400e1739c"><p> <strong class="question">What sections of Church dogma did Luther come to view in another way?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">penance and righteousness</span><span class="answer">penance and righteousness</span><span class="answer">penance and righteousness</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f80ad1a6d7ea1400e1739d"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther decide about the Catholic Church?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">corrupt in its ways</span><span class="answer">corrupt</span><span class="answer">corrupt</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f80ad1a6d7ea1400e1739e"><p> <strong class="question">What, to Luther had the Church lost sight of?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">central truths of Christianity</span><span class="answer">central truths of Christianity</span><span class="answer">several of the central truths of Christianity</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f80ad1a6d7ea1400e1739f"><p> <strong class="question">What is the central article of the Christian doctrine?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">doctrine of justification</span><span class="answer">doctrine of justification</span><span class="answer">salvation or redemption is a gift of God's grace, attainable only through faith in Jesus as the Messiah</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God. This teaching by Luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication On the Bondage of the Will, which was written in response to On Free Will by Desiderius Erasmus (1524). Luther based his position on predestination on St. Paul's epistle to the Ephesians 2:8–10. Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God, Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ, imputed to Christians (rather than infused into them) through faith. &quot;That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ.&quot; Faith, for Luther, was a gift from God; the experience of being justified by faith was &quot;as though I had been born again.&quot; His entry into Paradise, no less, was a discovery about &quot;the righteousness of God&quot; – a discovery that &quot;the just person&quot; of whom the Bible speaks (as in Romans 1:17) lives by faith. He explained his concept of &quot;justification&quot; in the Smalcald Articles:</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f80ccfaef2371900625d83"><p> <strong class="question">Of whom, to Luther, was justification entirely the work ?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">God</span><span class="answer">God</span><span class="answer">God</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f80ccfaef2371900625d84"><p> <strong class="question">When did Luther publish On the Bondage of the Will?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1525</span><span class="answer">1525</span><span class="answer">1525</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f80ccfaef2371900625d85"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther consider faith to be?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">gift from God</span><span class="answer">that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ</span><span class="answer">Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f80ccfaef2371900625d86"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Luther explain his idea of justification?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Smalcald Articles</span><span class="answer">the Smalcald Articles</span><span class="answer">Smalcald Articles</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f80ccfaef2371900625d87"><p> <strong class="question">By what did Luther believe the just person lives?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">lives by faith</span><span class="answer">faith</span><span class="answer">faith</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther's rediscovery of &quot;Christ and His salvation&quot; was the first of two points that became the foundation for the Reformation.

First, the Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini drafted a heresy case against Luther, whom Leo then summoned to Rome. The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg, where the Imperial Diet was held. There, in October 1518, under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist. The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy. The hearings degenerated into a shouting match. More than his writing the 95 Theses, Luther's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope. Cajetan's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant, but the legate desisted from doing so. Luther slipped out of the city at night, unbeknownst to Cajetan.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f811bdaef2371900625d9f"><p> <strong class="question">Which Pope sought to undermine Luther's theories?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Pope Leo X</span><span class="answer">Pope Leo X</span><span class="answer">Leo X</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f811bdaef2371900625da0"><p> <strong class="question">What did Pope Leo X launch against Luther?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">papal theologians and envoys</span><span class="answer">papal theologians and envoys</span><span class="answer">papal theologians and envoys</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f811bdaef2371900625da1"><p> <strong class="question">When was Luther examined at Augsburg by the papal legate?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">October 1518</span><span class="answer">October 1518</span><span class="answer">1518</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f811bdaef2371900625da2"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther tell the legate about the papacy?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">papacy was the Antichrist</span><span class="answer">papacy was the Antichrist</span><span class="answer">papacy was the Antichrist</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f811bdaef2371900625da3"><p> <strong class="question">What were the papal legate's orders from the Pope?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">arrest Luther</span><span class="answer">to arrest Luther</span><span class="answer">arrest</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In January 1519, at Altenburg in Saxony, the papal nuncio Karl von Miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach.

In June and July 1519, he staged a disputation with Luther's colleague Andreas Karlstadt at Leipzig and invited Luther to speak. Luther's boldest assertion in the debate was that Matthew 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture, and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible. For this, Eck branded Luther a new Jan Hus, referring to the Czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415. From that moment, he devoted himself to Luther's defeat.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f81393aef2371900625da9"><p> <strong class="question">When did papal nuncio Karl von Miltitz get Luther to make concessions ?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">January 1519</span><span class="answer">January 1519</span><span class="answer">1519</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f81393aef2371900625daa"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther promise to do as a concession?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">remain silent</span><span class="answer">remain silent</span><span class="answer">remain silent if his opponents did</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f81393aef2371900625dab"><p> <strong class="question">Who was determined to expose Luther at this time?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Johann Eck</span><span class="answer">Johann Eck</span><span class="answer">Eck</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f81393aef2371900625dac"><p> <strong class="question">What scripture did Luther use to back up his opinion that churchmen were not infallible?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Matthew 16:18</span><span class="answer">Matthew 16:18</span><span class="answer">Matthew 16:18</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f81393aef2371900625dad"><p> <strong class="question">What did Johann Eck call Luther?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">new Jan Hus</span><span class="answer">Jan Hus</span><span class="answer">new Jan Hus</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On 15 June 1520, the Pope warned Luther with the papal bull (edict) Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings, including the 95 Theses, within 60 days.

Karl von Miltitz, a papal nuncio, attempted to broker a solution, but Luther, who had sent the Pope a copy of On the Freedom of a Christian in October, publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at Wittenberg on 10 December 1520, an act he defended in Why the Pope and his Recent Book are Burned and Assertions Concerning All Articles.

He assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin, because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84485aef2371900625f71"><p> <strong class="question">When did Luther broaden his attacks to include core Church doctrines?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">summer of 1521</span><span class="answer">summer of 1521</span><span class="answer">1521</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84485aef2371900625f72"><p> <strong class="question">How did Luther describe the mass that was viewed as sacrifice?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">condemned as idolatry</span><span class="answer">idolatry</span><span class="answer">gift</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84485aef2371900625f73"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther call the mass instead of sacrifice?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a gift</span><span class="answer">gift</span><span class="answer">gift</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84485aef2371900625f74"><p> <strong class="question">After rejecting compulsory confession, what did Luther call for?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">private confession and absolution</span><span class="answer">private confession and absolution</span><span class="answer">private confession</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84485aef2371900625f75"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther tell monks and nuns about their vows?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">break their vows</span><span class="answer">illegitimate</span><span class="answer">break their vows without sin,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1521 Luther dealt largely with prophecy, in which he broadened the foundations of the Reformation placing them on prophetic faith.

Andreas Karlstadt, supported by the ex-Augustinian Gabriel Zwilling, embarked on a radical programme of reform there in June 1521, exceeding anything envisaged by Luther. The reforms provoked disturbances, including a revolt by the Augustinian friars against their prior, the smashing of statues and images in churches, and denunciations of the magistracy. After secretly visiting Wittenberg in early December 1521, Luther wrote A Sincere Admonition by Martin Luther to All Christians to Guard Against Insurrection and Rebellion. Wittenberg became even more volatile after Christmas when a band of visionary zealots, the so-called Zwickau prophets, arrived, preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man, adult baptism, and Christ's imminent return. When the town council asked Luther to return, he decided it was his duty to act.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84760aef2371900625f81"><p> <strong class="question">Who supported Andreas Karistadt in reform at Wittenberg?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Gabriel Zwilling</span><span class="answer">Gabriel Zwilling</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84760aef2371900625f82"><p> <strong class="question">When did Zwilling and Karistadt become active at Wittenberg?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">June 1521</span><span class="answer">June 1521</span><span class="answer">1521</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84760aef2371900625f83"><p> <strong class="question">What did the reforms cause?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">disturbances</span><span class="answer">disturbances</span><span class="answer">disturbances</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84760aef2371900625f84"><p> <strong class="question">What group was responsible for causing more violence in Wittenberg?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Zwickau prophets</span><span class="answer">Zwickau prophets</span><span class="answer">Augustinian friars</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84760aef2371900625f85"><p> <strong class="question">Who asked Luther to return to the city?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">town council</span><span class="answer">the town council</span><span class="answer">town council</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther secretly returned to Wittenberg on 6 March 1522.

There had been revolts by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century. Luther's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy, often worded with &quot;liberal&quot; phraseology, now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general. Revolts broke out in Franconia, Swabia, and Thuringia in 1524, even drawing support from disaffected nobles, many of whom were in debt. Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as Müntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol, the revolts turned into war.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84d33aef2371900625fb1"><p> <strong class="question">What was Nicholas Storch ?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Zwickau prophet</span><span class="answer">Preachers</span><span class="answer">Zwickau prophet</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84d33aef2371900625fb2"><p> <strong class="question">What event did Storch and Muntzer help instigate?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">German Peasants' War</span><span class="answer">German Peasants' War</span><span class="answer">German Peasants' War</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84d33aef2371900625fb3"><p> <strong class="question">When did The German Peasants War happen?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1524–25</span><span class="answer">1524–25</span><span class="answer">1524–25,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84d33aef2371900625fb4"><p> <strong class="question">What did the peasants believe Luther would do for them?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">support an attack</span><span class="answer">support an attack</span><span class="answer">support an attack on the upper classes</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f84d33aef2371900625fb5"><p> <strong class="question">Who did the peasants think Luther would support an attack on?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">upper classes</span><span class="answer">upper classes</span><span class="answer">upper classes</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther sympathised with some of the peasants' grievances, as he showed in his response to the Twelve Articles in May 1525, but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities.

Second, the violent actions of rebelling, robbing, and plundering placed the peasants &quot;outside the law of God and Empire&quot;, so they deserved &quot;death in body and soul, if only as highwaymen and murderers.&quot; Lastly, Luther charged the rebels with blasphemy for calling themselves &quot;Christian brethren&quot; and committing their sinful acts under the banner of the Gospel.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8507fa6d7ea1400e1754b"><p> <strong class="question">How many ways did Luther justify his opposition to revolt?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">on three grounds</span><span class="answer">three</span><span class="answer">three</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8507fa6d7ea1400e1754c"><p> <strong class="question">What were the protesters doing with Christ's counsel?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ignoring Christ's counsel</span><span class="answer">ignoring</span><span class="answer">ignoring</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8507fa6d7ea1400e1754d"><p> <strong class="question">By whom did St Paul say all authorities were appointed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">God</span><span class="answer">God</span><span class="answer">God</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8507fa6d7ea1400e1754e"><p> <strong class="question">What is this doctrine of God appointing authorities called?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Divine Right of Kings</span><span class="answer">Divine Right of Kings</span><span class="answer">Divine Right of Kings</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8507fa6d7ea1400e1754f"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of death did Luther say the revolting peasants deserve?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">in body and soul</span><span class="answer">death in body and soul</span><span class="answer">death in body and soul,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Without Luther's backing for the uprising, many rebels laid down their weapons; others felt betrayed.

His Biblical ideal of congregations' choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable. According to Bainton: &quot;Luther's dilemma was that he wanted both a confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality. If he were forced to choose, he would take his stand with the masses, and this was the direction in which he moved.&quot; From 1525 to 1529, he established a supervisory church body, laid down a new form of worship service, and wrote a clear summary of the new faith in the form of two catechisms. Luther's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a theology of the cross, the negation of every affirmation: as long as the cross is at the center, the system building tendency of reason is held in check, and system building does not degenerate into System.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8599aa6d7ea1400e175af"><p> <strong class="question">In organizing a new church, what did Luther find to be unworkable for congregations?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">choosing their own ministers</span><span class="answer">choosing their own ministers</span><span class="answer">confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8599aa6d7ea1400e175b0"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther form in 1525 to 1529?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">supervisory church body</span><span class="answer">supervisory church body</span><span class="answer">supervisory church</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8599aa6d7ea1400e175b1"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther establish as a worship service in his church?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">new form</span><span class="answer">a new form</span><span class="answer">two catechisms.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8599aa6d7ea1400e175b2"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther write as an outline of the new faith?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">two catechisms</span><span class="answer">two catechisms</span><span class="answer">two catechisms.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8599aa6d7ea1400e175b3"><p> <strong class="question">What is Luther's thought about the extent of his church?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">revolutionary</span><span class="answer">theology of the cross,</span><span class="answer">revolutionary</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>To avoid confusing or upsetting the people, Luther avoided extreme change. He also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another. He concentrated on the church in the Electorate of Saxony, acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories, many of which followed his Saxon model. He worked closely with the new elector, John the Steadfast, to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome. For Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, this partnership &quot;was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign&quot;. The elector authorised a visitation of the church, a power formerly exercised by bishops. At times, Luther's practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements. For example, the Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony (1528), drafted by Melanchthon with Luther's approval, stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins, despite Luther's position that faith alone ensures justification. The Eisleben reformer Johannes Agricola challenged this compromise, and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works. The Instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther's thought and practice.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f85bb8aef237190062600f"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther try to avoid in setting up his church?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">extreme change</span><span class="answer">extreme change</span><span class="answer">extreme change.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f85bb8aef2371900626010"><p> <strong class="question">Where was Luther mostly concentrating his efforts on reform?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Electorate of Saxony</span><span class="answer">Electorate of Saxony</span><span class="answer">Electorate</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f85bb8aef2371900626011"><p> <strong class="question">What role did Luther play in other areas' churches?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">adviser</span><span class="answer">adviser</span><span class="answer">adviser</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f85bb8aef2371900626012"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the new elector of Saxony?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">John the Steadfast</span><span class="answer">John the Steadfast</span><span class="answer">John the Steadfast,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f85bb8aef2371900626013"><p> <strong class="question">What unintended development did the relationship with the elector have on church government?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">under the temporal sovereign</span><span class="answer">church government under the temporal sovereign</span><span class="answer">church government under the temporal sovereign</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In response to demands for a German liturgy, Luther wrote a German Mass, which he published in early 1526. He did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the &quot;simple people&quot;, a &quot;public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians.&quot; Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted &quot;everything that smacks of sacrifice&quot;; and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread. He retained the elevation of the host and chalice, while trappings such as the Mass vestments, altar, and candles were made optional, allowing freedom of ceremony. Some reformers, including followers of Huldrych Zwingli, considered Luther's service too papistic; and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic mass. Luther's service, however, included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German, as well as of parts of the liturgy, including Luther's unison setting of the Creed. To reach the simple people and the young, Luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of the catechism. He also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f85cf0aef2371900626019"><p> <strong class="question">When did Luther write  a German mass?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">early 1526</span><span class="answer">1526</span><span class="answer">1526</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f85cf0aef237190062601a"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther not mean for the new mass to replace?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass</span><span class="answer">Latin Mass</span><span class="answer">adaptation of the Latin Mass</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f85cf0aef237190062601b"><p> <strong class="question">For whom was this new mass intended?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">simple people</span><span class="answer">simple people</span><span class="answer">&quot;simple people</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f85cf0aef237190062601c"><p> <strong class="question">What parts of the original Catholic mass did Luther leave out of  his new mass?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">sacrifice</span><span class="answer">everything that smacks of sacrifice</span><span class="answer">everything that smacks of sacrifice</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f85cf0aef237190062601d"><p> <strong class="question">What did the new mass allow as regards ceremony?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">freedom of ceremony</span><span class="answer">freedom</span><span class="answer">wine as well as the bread</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther and his colleagues introduced the new order of worship during their visitation of the Electorate of Saxony, which began in 1527.

The catechisms provided easy-to-understand instructional and devotional material on the Ten Commandments, the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, baptism, and the Lord's Supper.

Using the German vernacular, they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit. Luther's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity, each of which works in the catechumen's life. That is, Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned, but as persons to be known. The Father creates, the Son redeems, and the Spirit sanctifies, a divine unity with separate personalities. Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father. Luther's treatment of the Apostles' Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments) and the Lord's Prayer, which are also part of the Lutheran catechical teaching.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f86966aef2371900626053"><p> <strong class="question">Which work of Luther's is effective in teaching children?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Small Catechism</span><span class="answer">Small Catechism</span><span class="answer">Small Catechism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f86966aef2371900626054"><p> <strong class="question">What work is useful for pastors?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Larger Catechism</span><span class="answer">Larger Catechism</span><span class="answer">Larger Catechism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f86966aef2371900626055"><p> <strong class="question">What are the Catechisms of Martin Luther written in?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">German vernacular</span><span class="answer">German</span><span class="answer">German</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f86966aef2371900626056"><p> <strong class="question">How did Luther show the Trinity in his catechisms?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">as persons</span><span class="answer">persons to be known.</span><span class="answer">Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f86966aef2371900626057"><p> <strong class="question">Where does Luther place Salvation?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">with the Father</span><span class="answer">with the Father</span><span class="answer">Father</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther had published his German translation of the New Testament in 1522, and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the Old Testament in 1534, when the whole Bible was published.

He often accompanied the sung hymns with a lute, later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of Germany in the 20th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87000aef2371900626071"><p> <strong class="question">In what type of work was Luther prolific?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">authoring hymns</span><span class="answer">hymn-writer</span><span class="answer">hymn-writer</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87000aef2371900626072"><p> <strong class="question">What art forms did Luther use to connect his hymns?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">high art and folk music</span><span class="answer">high art and folk music</span><span class="answer">singing of German hymns in connection with worship</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87000aef2371900626073"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther use to celebrate worship?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">singing of German hymns</span><span class="answer">singing of German hymns</span><span class="answer">singing</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87000aef2371900626074"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther use as accompaniment to his hymns?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">lute</span><span class="answer">a lute</span><span class="answer">singing</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87000aef2371900626075"><p> <strong class="question">What instrument became a national instrument in Germany?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">waldzither</span><span class="answer">waldzither</span><span class="answer">waldzither</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation.

Luther's hymn, adapted and expanded from an earlier German creedal hymn, gained widespread use in vernacular Lutheran liturgies as early as 1525. Sixteenth-century Lutheran hymnals also included &quot;Wir glauben all&quot; among the catechetical hymns, although 18th-century hymnals tended to label the hymn as Trinitarian rather than catechetical, and 20th-century Lutherans rarely use the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87392aef2371900626099"><p> <strong class="question">When did Luther write Wir glauben all an einen Gott?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1524</span><span class="answer">1524</span><span class="answer">1524</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87392aef237190062609a"><p> <strong class="question">What did this hymn presage?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Apostles' Creed</span><span class="answer">explanation of the Apostles' Creed</span><span class="answer">three-part explanation of the Apostles' Creed</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87392aef237190062609b"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the Apostles located?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Small Catechism</span><span class="answer">Small Catechism</span><span class="answer">Small Catechism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87392aef237190062609c"><p> <strong class="question">What earlier hymn was Luther's  adapted from?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">German creedal hymn</span><span class="answer">creedal</span><span class="answer">earlier German creedal hymn,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87392aef237190062609d"><p> <strong class="question">Why have modern Lutherans stopped using the hymn?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">difficulty of its tune</span><span class="answer">perceived difficulty of its tune</span><span class="answer">difficulty of its tune</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther's 1538 hymnic version of the Lord's Prayer, &quot;Vater unser im Himmelreich&quot;, corresponds exactly to Luther's explanation of the prayer in the Small Catechism, with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions, plus opening and closing stanzas. The hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the Lord's Prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions. The extant manuscript shows multiple revisions, demonstrating Luther's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune.

In a collaboration with Paul Speratus, this and seven other hymns were published in the Achtliederbuch, the first Lutheran hymnal. In 1524 Luther developed his original four-stanza psalm paraphrase into a five-stanza Reformation hymn that developed the theme of &quot;grace alone&quot; more fully. Because it expressed essential Reformation doctrine, this expanded version of &quot;Aus tiefer Not&quot; was designated as a regular component of several regional Lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals, including Luther's own. Along with Erhart Hegenwalt's hymnic version of Psalm 51, Luther's expanded hymn was also adopted for use with the fifth part of Luther's catechism, concerning confession.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87760aef23719006260cc"><p> <strong class="question">When did Luther write the hymn From Depths of Woe I cry to You?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1523</span><span class="answer">1523</span><span class="answer">1523</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87760aef23719006260cd"><p> <strong class="question">What is the basis of the hymn?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Psalm 130</span><span class="answer">Psalm 130</span><span class="answer">Psalm 130</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87760aef23719006260ce"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther use the hymn to encourage colleagues to do?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">write psalm-hymns</span><span class="answer">write psalm-hymns</span><span class="answer">to write psalm-hymns</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87760aef23719006260cf"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first Lutheran hymnal?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Achtliederbuch</span><span class="answer">Achtliederbuch</span><span class="answer">Achtliederbuch</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f87760aef23719006260d0"><p> <strong class="question">What did the hymn, Aus tiefer Not express?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Reformation doctrine</span><span class="answer">essential Reformation doctrine</span><span class="answer">essential Reformation doctrine</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther wrote &quot;Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein&quot; (&quot;Oh God, look down from heaven&quot;). &quot;Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland&quot; (Now come, Savior of the gentiles), based on Veni redemptor gentium, became the main hymn (Hauptlied) for Advent.

This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints: &quot;It is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell, but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace.&quot; He also rejected the existence of Purgatory, which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death.

Luther insisted on the Real Presence of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine, which he called the sacramental union, while his opponents believed God to be only spiritually or symbolically present. Zwingli, for example, denied Jesus' ability to be in more than one place at a time but Luther stressed the omnipresence of his human nature. According to transcripts, the debate sometimes became confrontational. Citing Jesus' words &quot;The flesh profiteth nothing&quot; (John 6.63), Zwingli said, &quot;This passage breaks your neck&quot;. &quot;Don't be too proud,&quot; Luther retorted, &quot;German necks don't break that easily.

He wrote, &quot;All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false.&quot; and &quot;[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things.&quot; However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason &quot;strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it&quot;, bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to. Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work &quot;Fides und Ratio&quot; that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f895339e9bad19000a0177"><p> <strong class="question">What do scholars sometimes assert that Luther believed about what faith and reason were to each other?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">antithetical</span><span class="answer">antithetical</span><span class="answer">antithetical</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f895339e9bad19000a0178"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther think that faith could not be understood by?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">reason</span><span class="answer">reason</span><span class="answer">human reason</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f895339e9bad19000a0179"><p> <strong class="question">How did Luther say that reason contributes to faith?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">no way contributes</span><span class="answer">in no way</span><span class="answer">in no way</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f895339e9bad19000a017a"><p> <strong class="question">What was faith's greatest enemy according to Luther?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">reason</span><span class="answer">reason</span><span class="answer">Reason</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f895339e9bad19000a017b"><p> <strong class="question">By separating faith and reason, what does Luther honor?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">different epistemological spheres.</span><span class="answer">separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to</span><span class="answer">separate spheres of knowledge</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1523, Luther wrote that Jesus Christ was born a Jew which discouraged mistreatment of the Jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the Old Testament could be shown to speak of Jesus Christ. However, as the Reformation continued, Luther began to lose hope in large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity. In his later years, Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists, Zwinglianism, and the papacy. His 1543 treatise Von den Juden und ihren Lügen (On the Jews and Their Lies) took its place among other anti-Jewish literature of the times, although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme, even by the standards of sixteenth century Europe. In it, he takes a hardline against Judaism, writing that synagogues and Jewish homes should be destroyed, their money confiscated, and liberty curtailed. These statements and their influence on antisemitism have contributed to his controversial status.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f897059b226e1400dd0c5d"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther state as a means of discouraging mistreatment of Jews?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Jesus Christ was born a Jew</span><span class="answer">that Jesus Christ was born a Jew</span><span class="answer">conversion</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f897059b226e1400dd0c5e"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther gradually see as hopeless in the Reformation?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Jewish conversion to Christianity</span><span class="answer">large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity</span><span class="answer">large-scale Jewish conversion</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f897059b226e1400dd0c5f"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Luther strike out against in later years?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Jews</span><span class="answer">Jews</span><span class="answer">Jews</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f897059b226e1400dd0c60"><p> <strong class="question">Luther treated Jews in a like way as he treated what group?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Anabaptists</span><span class="answer">Anabaptists, Zwinglianism, and the papacy</span><span class="answer">Anabaptists</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f897059b226e1400dd0c61"><p> <strong class="question">When did Luther write an extreme treatise against the Jews?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1543</span><span class="answer">1543</span><span class="answer">1543</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the time of the Marburg Colloquy, Suleiman the Magnificent was besieging Vienna with a vast Ottoman army. Luther had argued against resisting the Turks in his 1518 Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses, provoking accusations of defeatism. He saw the Turks as a scourge sent to punish Christians by God, as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist, whom Luther believed to be the papacy, and the Roman Church. He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War, &quot;as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks, who were enemies of Christ. This is absolutely contrary to Christ's doctrine and name&quot;. On the other hand, in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms, Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks. In 1526, he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for a just war. By 1529, in On War against the Turk, he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks. He made clear, however, that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate, to be waged through prayer and repentance. Around the time of the Siege of Vienna, Luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the Turks, asking God to &quot;give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8989f9e9bad19000a01a5"><p> <strong class="question">How did Luther view the Ottoman Turks?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">as a scourge</span><span class="answer">scourge</span><span class="answer">argued against resisting</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8989f9e9bad19000a01a6"><p> <strong class="question">What was the purpose of the Turks in Luther's mind?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">to punish Christians</span><span class="answer">punish Christians by God</span><span class="answer">scourge sent to punish Christians</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8989f9e9bad19000a01a7"><p> <strong class="question">Since Luther believed that the Turks were sent by God, what was their purpose?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">destroy the antichrist</span><span class="answer">destroy the antichrist</span><span class="answer">punish</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8989f9e9bad19000a01a8"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Luther view to be the Antichrist?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the papacy</span><span class="answer">papacy</span><span class="answer">papacy</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8989f9e9bad19000a01a9"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of war did Luther support against the Turks, even if he did not oppose a religious war?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">secular war</span><span class="answer">non-religious</span><span class="answer">non-religious war</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1542, Luther read a Latin translation of the Qur'an.

Based on this sermon and others by Agricola, Luther suspected that Agricola was behind certain anonymous antinomian theses circulating in Wittenberg. These theses asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to Christians but belonged only to city hall. Luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against Agricola and the antinomians, four of which became the basis for disputations between 1538 and 1540. He also responded to these assertions in other writings, such as his 1539 open letter to C. Güttel Against the Antinomians, and his book On the Councils and the Church from the same year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8a2969e9bad19000a022b"><p> <strong class="question">What did Johannes Agricola preach that God's gospel revealed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">God's wrath to Christians</span><span class="answer">God's wrath</span><span class="answer">God's wrath to Christians.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8a2969e9bad19000a022c"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Luther think was behind the antinomian theses circulating in Wittenberg?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Johannes Agricola</span><span class="answer">Agricola</span><span class="answer">Agricola</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8a2969e9bad19000a022d"><p> <strong class="question">What did Agricola apparently believe about who should be in control  law?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">city hall</span><span class="answer">city hall</span><span class="answer">city hall.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8a2969e9bad19000a022e"><p> <strong class="question">How did Luther respond to Agricola?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">theses against Agricola</span><span class="answer">six series of theses</span><span class="answer">six series of theses against Agricola</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8a2969e9bad19000a022f"><p> <strong class="question">What book did Luther write in response to Agricola and the antinomians?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">On the Councils and the Church</span><span class="answer">On the Councils and the Church</span><span class="answer">On the Councils</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In his theses and disputations against the antinomians, Luther reviews and reaffirms, on the one hand, what has been called the &quot;second use of the law,&quot; that is, the law as the Holy Spirit's tool to work sorrow over sin in man's heart, thus preparing him for Christ's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel. Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law, even if it is Christ's life, Christ's death for sin, or God's goodness experienced in creation. Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby, as it were, removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law. Claiming that the law – in any form – should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8a4e99e9bad19000a0251"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther's answer to the antinomians reaffirms?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">second use of the law</span><span class="answer">second use of the law</span><span class="answer">second use of the law</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8a4e99e9bad19000a0252"><p> <strong class="question">What is the use of the law by the Holy Spirit?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">work sorrow over sin</span><span class="answer">work sorrow over sin in man's heart</span><span class="answer">work sorrow over sin in man's heart</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8a4e99e9bad19000a0253"><p> <strong class="question">What is Luther's opinion of what the law covers??</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">everything</span><span class="answer">everything</span><span class="answer">everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8a4e99e9bad19000a0254"><p> <strong class="question">What does refusing to preach the Ten Commandments not do?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">eliminate the accusing law</span><span class="answer">eliminate the accusing law.</span><span class="answer">eliminate the accusing law</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8a4e99e9bad19000a0255"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther claim the church would have to comprise if the law were not taught?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">essentially holy people</span><span class="answer">holy people</span><span class="answer">only of essentially holy people</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>On the other hand, Luther also points out that the Ten Commandments – when considered not as God's condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will, that is, of the natural law – also positively teach how the Christian ought to live.

Philip solicited the approval of Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer, citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs. The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling, and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined, he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter. As a result, on 4 March 1540, Philip married a second wife, Margarethe von der Saale, with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses. However, Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret, and he threatened to make Luther's advice public. Luther told him to &quot;tell a good, strong lie&quot; and deny the marriage completely, which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy. In the view of Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, &quot;giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made, and, next to the landgrave himself, who was directly responsible for it, history chiefly holds Luther accountable&quot;. Brecht argues that Luther's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice, but that he miscalculated the political implications. The affair caused lasting damage to Luther's reputation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8ac579e9bad19000a02b9"><p> <strong class="question">What did Philip I wish to do around 1539?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">wanted to marry</span><span class="answer">marry one of his wife's ladies-in-waiting</span><span class="answer">marry one of his wife's ladies-in-waiting.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8ac579e9bad19000a02ba"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther get implicated in concerning Philip I?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">bigamy</span><span class="answer">bigamy</span><span class="answer">bigamy</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8ac579e9bad19000a02bb"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Philip I want to marry?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">one of his wife's ladies-in-waiting</span><span class="answer">Margarethe von der Saale</span><span class="answer">one of his wife's ladies-in-waiting</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8ac579e9bad19000a02bc"><p> <strong class="question">Who does history view as accountable for the error Philip I made and Luther's advice in the matter?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">holds Luther accountable</span><span class="answer">Luther</span><span class="answer">one of the worst mistakes Luther made,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8ac579e9bad19000a02bd"><p> <strong class="question">What did this affair cause to Luther's reputation?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">lasting damage</span><span class="answer">lasting damage</span><span class="answer">caused lasting damage</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther wrote about the Jews throughout his career, though only a few of his works dealt with them directly. Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life, but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ, and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier. He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus, whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah. But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty. As early as 1516, he wrote that many people &quot;are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs, evildoers, or whatever they like, while they too, and equally, do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God&quot;. In 1523, Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity. When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them. In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy, Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luther's attitude towards Jews &quot;unraveled along with his health.&quot;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8ae099e9bad19000a02eb"><p> <strong class="question">What had Luther's community done to Jews years earlier?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">expelled Jews</span><span class="answer">expelled</span><span class="answer">expelled</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8ae099e9bad19000a02ec"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Luther write about, but seldom met?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Jews</span><span class="answer">Jews</span><span class="answer">Jews</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8ae099e9bad19000a02ed"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther's area and tradition believe Jews to be guilty of?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">murder of Christ</span><span class="answer">murder of Christ</span><span class="answer">murder of Christ,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8ae099e9bad19000a02ee"><p> <strong class="question">What did Jews refuse to accept that caused Luther to call them blasphemers and liars?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">divinity of Jesus</span><span class="answer">Jesus</span><span class="answer">divinity of Jesus</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8ae099e9bad19000a02ef"><p> <strong class="question">What did Luther try to do for the Jews?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">convert them to Christianity.</span><span class="answer">convert</span><span class="answer">convert</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther's other major works on the Jews were his 60,000-word treatise Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen (On the Jews and Their Lies), and Vom Schem Hamphoras und vom Geschlecht Christi (On the Holy Name and the Lineage of Christ), both published in 1543, three years before his death. Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but &quot;the devil's people&quot;, and referred to them with violent, vile language. Citing Deuteronomy 13, wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God, Luther called for a &quot;scharfe Barmherzigkeit&quot; (&quot;sharp mercy&quot;) against the Jews &quot;to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames.&quot; Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire, destroying Jewish prayerbooks, forbidding rabbis from preaching, seizing Jews' property and money, and smashing up their homes, so that these &quot;envenomed worms&quot; would be forced into labour or expelled &quot;for all time&quot;. In Robert Michael's view, Luther's words &quot;We are at fault in not slaying them&quot; amounted to a sanction for murder. &quot;God's anger with them is so intense,&quot; Luther concluded, &quot;that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse, while sharp mercy will reform them but little.

Reinhold Lewin writes that anybody who &quot;wrote against the Jews for whatever reason believed he had the right to justify himself by triumphantly referring to Luther.&quot; According to Michael, just about every anti-Jewish book printed in the Third Reich contained references to and quotations from Luther. Heinrich Himmler wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the Jews in 1940. The city of Nuremberg presented a first edition of On the Jews and their Lies to Julius Streicher, editor of the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer, on his birthday in 1937; the newspaper described it as the most radically anti-Semitic tract ever published. It was publicly exhibited in a glass case at the Nuremberg rallies and quoted in a 54-page explanation of the Aryan Law by Dr. E.H. Schulz and Dr. R.

Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic. Biographer Martin Brecht points out that &quot;There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology. Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer.&quot; Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology. Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history. Similarly, Roland Bainton, noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote &quot;One could wish that Luther had died before ever [On the Jews and Their Lies] was written.

Probst in his book Demonizing the Jews: Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany (2012), shows that a large number of German Lutheran clergy and theologians during the Nazi Third Reich used Luther's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8bbb09e9bad19000a03db"><p> <strong class="question">Other scholars contend that Luther's words lent what element to Christian suspicion of Jews?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">violence</span><span class="answer">violence</span><span class="answer">violence</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8bbb09e9bad19000a03dc"><p> <strong class="question">Who thinks that Luther added antisemitism as a cultural element to Germany?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Ronald Berger</span><span class="answer">Ronald Berger</span><span class="answer">Berger</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8bbb09e9bad19000a03dd"><p> <strong class="question">What did Paul Rose say Luther added to German thought?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">hysterical and demonizing mentality</span><span class="answer">a &quot;hysterical and demonizing mentality&quot; about Jews</span><span class="answer">hysterical and demonizing mentality</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8bbb09e9bad19000a03de"><p> <strong class="question">Who aide the Reich in Germany in antisemitism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Lutheran clergy and theologians</span><span class="answer">German Lutheran clergy and theologians</span><span class="answer">Luther</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8bbb09e9bad19000a03df"><p> <strong class="question">What did these Lutheran clerics use as fuel to bolster the Policies of the Nazis?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Luther's hostile publications</span><span class="answer">Luther's hostile publications</span><span class="answer">Luther's hostile publications towards the Jews</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some scholars, such as Mark U.

In contrast to images of frail Catholic saints, Luther was presented as a stout man with a &quot;double chin, strong mouth, piercing deep-set eyes, fleshy face, and squat neck.&quot; He was shown to be physically imposing, an equal in stature to the secular German princes with whom he would join forces to spread Lutheranism. His large body also let the viewer know that he did not shun earthly pleasures like drinking—behavior that was a stark contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders. Famous images from this period include the woodcuts by Hans Brosamer (1530) and Lucas Cranach the Elder and Lucas Cranach the Younger (1546).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8cc399e9bad19000a0514"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of images of Luther were used to advertise Protestantism? </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">monumental</span><span class="answer">printed images of Luther that emphasized his monumental size</span><span class="answer">printed</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8cc399e9bad19000a0515"><p> <strong class="question">In contrast how were Catholic saints portrayed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">frail Catholic saints</span><span class="answer">frail</span><span class="answer">frail</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8cc399e9bad19000a0516"><p> <strong class="question">How was Luther presented as an image to spread Protestantism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">physically imposing</span><span class="answer">physically imposing</span><span class="answer">stout man</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8cc399e9bad19000a0517"><p> <strong class="question">What was the image of Luther a contrast to the life of?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">religious orders</span><span class="answer">medieval religious orders</span><span class="answer">ascetic life of the medieval religious orders</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56f8cc399e9bad19000a0518"><p> <strong class="question">When were images being used to promote the spread of Lutheranism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1530s and 1540s</span><span class="answer">1530s and 1540s</span><span class="answer">1530s and 1540s</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Luther is honoured on 18 February with a commemoration in the Lutheran Calendar of Saints and in the Episcopal (United States) Calendar of Saints.
