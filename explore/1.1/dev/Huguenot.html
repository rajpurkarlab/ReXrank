As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew, in spite of increasingly liberal political concessions and edicts of toleration from the French crown. A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the Wars of Religion, fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The wars finally ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes, which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57105da9a58dae1900cd699e"><p> <strong class="question">Where was France's Huguenot population largely centered?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the southern and central parts of France</span><span class="answer">southern and central parts of France,</span><span class="answer">about one-eighth</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57105da9a58dae1900cd699f"><p> <strong class="question">What was the proportion of Huguenots to Catholics at their peak?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">about one-eighth the number</span><span class="answer">about one-eighth</span><span class="answer">about one-eighth</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57105da9a58dae1900cd69a0"><p> <strong class="question">When were the Wars of Religion fought?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">from 1562 to 1598</span><span class="answer">1562 to 1598</span><span class="answer">562 to 1598</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57105da9a58dae1900cd69a1"><p> <strong class="question">What treaty ended the Wars of Religion?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Edict of Nantes</span><span class="answer">Edict of Nantes</span><span class="answer">the Edict of Nantes</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57105da9a58dae1900cd69a2"><p> <strong class="question">What did this agreement do?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy</span><span class="answer">granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy</span><span class="answer">granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A term used originally in derision, Huguenot has unclear origins. Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in &quot;a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy&quot;). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the &quot;Confederate Party&quot;, so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57106185b654c5140001f8db"><p> <strong class="question">The term Huguenot was originally meant to confer?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">derision</span><span class="answer">derision</span><span class="answer">derision</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57106185b654c5140001f8dd"><p> <strong class="question">What Swiss city was the center of the Calvinist movement?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Geneva</span><span class="answer">Geneva</span><span class="answer">Geneva</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57106185b654c5140001f8dc"><p> <strong class="question">The term may be related to what politician from Switzerland?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Besançon Hugues</span><span class="answer">Besançon Hugues</span><span class="answer">Besançon Hugues</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57106185b654c5140001f8de"><p> <strong class="question">What name was given to the plot to usurp power from the French House of Guise?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Amboise plot</span><span class="answer">Amboise</span><span class="answer">the Amboise plot</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57106185b654c5140001f8df"><p> <strong class="question">When did this attempt take place?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1560</span><span class="answer">1560</span><span class="answer">1560</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The availability of the Bible in vernacular languages was important to the spread of the Protestant movement and development of the Reformed church in France.

The couple left for the Far East ten years later. On 31 December 1687 the first organised group of Huguenots set sail from the Netherlands to the Dutch East India Company post at the Cape of Good Hope. The largest portion of the Huguenots to settle in the Cape arrived between 1688 and 1689 in seven ships as part of the organised migration, but quite a few arrived as late as 1700; thereafter, the numbers declined and only small groups arrived at a time.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571077ecb654c5140001f909"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the first Huguenot colonists settle?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">at the Cape of Good Hope</span><span class="answer">Cape of Good Hope</span><span class="answer">the Cape of Good Hope</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571077ecb654c5140001f90a"><p> <strong class="question">What modern city is located on the original Huguenot colony?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Cape Town</span><span class="answer">Cape Town</span><span class="answer">Cape Town</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571077ecb654c5140001f90b"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Maria de la Queillerie</span><span class="answer">Maria de la Queillerie</span><span class="answer">Maria de la Queillerie</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571077ecb654c5140001f90c"><p> <strong class="question">What trading company helped settle Huguenots near the Cape?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Dutch East India Company</span><span class="answer">Dutch East India Company</span><span class="answer">Dutch East India Company</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571077ecb654c5140001f90d"><p> <strong class="question">The number of new Huguenot colonists declined after what year?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1700</span><span class="answer">1700</span><span class="answer">1700</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Barred by the government from settling in New France, Huguenots led by Jessé de Forest, sailed to North America in 1624 and settled instead in the Dutch colony of New Netherland (later incorporated into New York and New Jersey); as well as Great Britain's colonies, including Nova Scotia. A number of New Amsterdam's families were of Huguenot origin, often having emigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century. In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam (the French church in New Amsterdam). This parish continues today as L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit, part of the Episcopal (Anglican) communion, and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world. Upon their arrival in New Amsterdam, Huguenots were offered land directly across from Manhattan on Long Island for a permanent settlement and chose the harbor at the end of Newtown Creek, becoming the first Europeans to live in Brooklyn, then known as Boschwick, in the neighborhood now known as Bushwick.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57107932a58dae1900cd69ca"><p> <strong class="question">When did Huguenots colonize in North America?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1624</span><span class="answer">1624</span><span class="answer">1624</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57107932a58dae1900cd69cb"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the North American Huguenot colonial expedition?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Jessé de Forest</span><span class="answer">Jessé de Forest</span><span class="answer">Jessé de Forest</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57107932a58dae1900cd69cc"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the first Huguenot church in the New World?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam</span><span class="answer">L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam</span><span class="answer">L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam (the French church in New Amsterdam)</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57107932a58dae1900cd69cd"><p> <strong class="question">By what name is that first Huguenot church known today?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit</span><span class="answer">L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit</span><span class="answer">L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57107932a58dae1900cd69ce"><p> <strong class="question">The Huguenots were the first Europeans to live in what modern New York borough?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Brooklyn</span><span class="answer">Brooklyn</span><span class="answer">Brooklyn</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the early years, many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day Charleston, South Carolina.

After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent, including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne, Jean Postell of Dieppe France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger.

A fort, named Fort Coligny, was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian Native Americans. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured part of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to Catholicism. The Huguenots of Guanabara, as they are now known, produced a declaration of faith to express their beliefs to the Portuguese. This was their death sentence.

The implication that the style of lace known as 'Bucks Point' demonstrates a Huguenot influence, being a &quot;combination of Mechlin patterns on Lille ground&quot;, is fallacious: what is now known as Mechlin lace did not develop until first half of the eighteenth century and lace with Mechlin patterns and Lille ground did not appear until the end of the 18th century, when it was widely copied throughout Europe.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571098f8a58dae1900cd6ab2"><p> <strong class="question">What industry was centered in Bedfordshire?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">lace</span><span class="answer">lace</span><span class="answer">British lace</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571098f8a58dae1900cd6ab3"><p> <strong class="question">What style of lace is erroneously believed by some to have Huguenot influence?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">'Bucks Point'</span><span class="answer">Bucks Point</span><span class="answer">Bucks Point</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571098f8a58dae1900cd6ab4"><p> <strong class="question">What reference is there to Huguenot lacemakers in the 19th century?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">twenty-five widows who settled in Dover</span><span class="answer">twenty-five widows who settled in Dover</span><span class="answer">twenty-five widows who settled in Dover</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571098f8a58dae1900cd6ab5"><p> <strong class="question">When did Mechlin lace develop?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">first half of the eighteenth century</span><span class="answer">first half of the eighteenth century</span><span class="answer">first half of the eighteenth century</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In Berlin, the Huguenots created two new neighbourhoods: Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt.

Following this exodus, Huguenots remained in large numbers in only one region of France: the rugged Cévennes region in the south. In the early 18th century, a regional group known as the Camisards who were Huguenots rioted against the Catholic Church in the region, burning churches and killing clergy.

The Wars of Religion precluded a return voyage, and the outpost was abandoned. In 1564, Ribault's former lieutenant René Goulaine de Laudonnière launched a second voyage to build a colony; he established Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville, Florida. War at home again precluded a resupply mission, and the colony struggled. In 1565 the Spanish decided to enforce their claim to La Florida, and sent Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, who established the settlement of St. Augustine near Fort Caroline.

Some settlers landed in present-day Chesterfield County. On 12 May 1705, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown. Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement, many had died; others lived outside town on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas. Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbors. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont, and across the Appalachian Mountains into the West of what became Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states. In the Manakintown area, the Huguenot Memorial Bridge across the James River and Huguenot Road were named in their honor, as were many local features, including several schools, including Huguenot High School.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5710eca0a58dae1900cd6b3a"><p> <strong class="question">In what English colony were Huguenot settlers promised land?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Virginia</span><span class="answer">Virginia</span><span class="answer">Virginia</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5710eca0a58dae1900cd6b3b"><p> <strong class="question">In what area of this British colony were Huguenot land grants?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Lower Norfolk County</span><span class="answer">Lower Norfolk County</span><span class="answer">Lower Norfolk County</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5710eca0a58dae1900cd6b3c"><p> <strong class="question">What town was actually granted to the Huguenots on arrival?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Manakin Town</span><span class="answer">Manakin Town</span><span class="answer">Manakin Town</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5710eca0a58dae1900cd6b3d"><p> <strong class="question">How many settlers original settled in Manakintown?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">390</span><span class="answer">390</span><span class="answer">390</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5710eca0a58dae1900cd6b3e"><p> <strong class="question">When were these settlers naturalized as English colonists?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">12 May 1705</span><span class="answer">1705</span><span class="answer">12 May 1705</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some Huguenots fought in the Low Countries alongside the Dutch against Spain during the first years of the Dutch Revolt (1568–1609). The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles. Early ties were already visible in the &quot;Apologie&quot; of William the Silent, condemning the Spanish Inquisition, which was written by his court minister, the Huguenot Pierre L'Oyseleur, lord of Villiers. Louise de Coligny, daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, married William the Silent, leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule. As both spoke French in daily life, their court church in the Prinsenhof in Delft held services in French. The practice has continued to the present day. The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active Walloon churches of the Dutch Reformed Church. The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic's military and political leadership, the House of Orange-Nassau, which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic's colonies.

Smaller settlements, which included Killeshandra in County Cavan, contributed to the expansion of flax cultivation and the growth of the Irish linen industry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5710f2e2a58dae1900cd6b72"><p> <strong class="question">What war in Ireland featured Huguenot regiments?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Williamite war</span><span class="answer">Williamite</span><span class="answer">the Williamite war</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5710f2e2a58dae1900cd6b73"><p> <strong class="question">Under which leader did the Huguenots fight in this conflict?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">William of Orange</span><span class="answer">William of Orange</span><span class="answer">William of Orange</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5710f2e2a58dae1900cd6b74"><p> <strong class="question">Which Irish cities had large Huguenot enclaves?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Dublin, Cork, Portarlington, Lisburn, Waterford and Youghal</span><span class="answer">Dublin, Cork, Portarlington, Lisburn, Waterford and Youghal</span><span class="answer">Dublin, Cork, Portarlington, Lisburn, Waterford and Youghal</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5710f2e2a58dae1900cd6b75"><p> <strong class="question">Huguenots in Killeshandra and County Cavan expanded what agricultural industry?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">flax cultivation</span><span class="answer">flax</span><span class="answer">flax cultivation</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5710f2e2a58dae1900cd6b76"><p> <strong class="question">What textile industry did the Huguenots contribute to in Ireland?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Irish linen industry</span><span class="answer">linen</span><span class="answer">Irish linen</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Prince Louis de Condé, along with his sons Daniel and Osias,[citation needed] arranged with Count Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbrücken to establish a Huguenot community in present-day Saarland in 1604. The Count supported mercantilism and welcomed technically skilled immigrants into his lands, regardless of their religion. The Condés established a thriving glass-making works, which provided wealth to the principality for many years. Other founding families created enterprises based on textiles and such traditional Huguenot occupations in France. The community and its congregation remain active to this day, with descendants of many of the founding families still living in the region.

The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power. During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530. William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin (John Calvin), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join William Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivetan published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly Calvinistic influence. Sometime between 1550 and 1580, members of the Reformed church in France came to be commonly known as Huguenots.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111380a58dae1900cd6bd6"><p> <strong class="question">Who was one French pro-reform Roman Catholic of the 15th century? </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Jacques Lefevre</span><span class="answer">Jacques Lefevre</span><span class="answer">Jacques Lefevre</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111380a58dae1900cd6bd7"><p> <strong class="question">Where did this pro-reform leader teach?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">University of Paris</span><span class="answer">University of Paris</span><span class="answer">University of Paris</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111380a58dae1900cd6bd8"><p> <strong class="question">When did this leader publish a French language Bible?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1530</span><span class="answer">1523</span><span class="answer">1530</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111380a58dae1900cd6bd9"><p> <strong class="question">What leader of the Swiss reformation was a student of Lefevre?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">William Farel</span><span class="answer">William Farel</span><span class="answer">William Farel</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111380a58dae1900cd6bda"><p> <strong class="question">What other European Protestant leader was educated at the University of Paris?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Jean Cauvin (John Calvin)</span><span class="answer">Jean Cauvin</span><span class="answer">Jean Cauvin</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In what became known as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 24 August – 3 October 1572, Catholics killed thousands of Huguenots in Paris.

It is said that they landed on the coastline peninsula of Davenports Neck called &quot;Bauffet's Point&quot; after traveling from England where they had previously taken refuge on account of religious persecution, four years before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They purchased from John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor, a tract of land consisting of six thousand one hundred acres with the help of Jacob Leisler. It was named New Rochelle after La Rochelle, their former strong-hold in France. A small wooden church was first erected in the community, followed by a second church that built of stone. Previous to the erection of it, the strong men would often walk twenty-three miles on Saturday evening, the distance by the road from New Rochelle to New York, to attend the Sunday service. The church was eventually replaced by a third, Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church, which contains heirlooms including the original bell from the French Huguenot Church &quot;Eglise du St. Esperit&quot; on Pine Street in New York City, which is preserved as a relic in the tower room. The Huguenot cemetery, or &quot;Huguenot Burial Ground&quot;, has since been recognized as a historic cemetery that is the final resting place for a wide range of the Huguenot founders, early settlers and prominent citizens dating back more than three centuries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711163bb654c5140001fb13"><p> <strong class="question">What present day county is New Rochelle in?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Westchester</span><span class="answer">Westchester</span><span class="answer">Westchester</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711163bb654c5140001fb14"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Huguenots land in New York originally?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">&quot;Bauffet's Point&quot;</span><span class="answer">Bauffet's Point</span><span class="answer">Bauffet's Point</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711163bb654c5140001fb15"><p> <strong class="question">From whom did the Huguenots purchase the land where they settled?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor</span><span class="answer">John Pell</span><span class="answer">John Pell</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711163bb654c5140001fb16"><p> <strong class="question">What French City was New Rochelle named after?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">La Rochelle</span><span class="answer">La Rochelle</span><span class="answer">La Rochelle</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711163bb654c5140001fb17"><p> <strong class="question">What is the name of the third, permanent Huguenot church in New Rochelle?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church</span><span class="answer">Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church</span><span class="answer">Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Most of the Huguenot congregations (or individuals) in North America eventually affiliated with other Protestant denominations with more numerous members.

Assimilated, the French made numerous contributions to United States economic life, especially as merchants and artisans in the late Colonial and early Federal periods. For example, E.I. du Pont, a former student of Lavoisier, established the Eleutherian gunpowder mills.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111713a58dae1900cd6c00"><p> <strong class="question">How did Huguenots evolve their religious beliefs in the New World?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">affiliated with other Protestant denominations</span><span class="answer">affiliated with other Protestant denominations</span><span class="answer">affiliated with other Protestant denominations with more numerous members</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111713a58dae1900cd6c01"><p> <strong class="question">How were Huguenot settlers assimilated into North American society at large?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">married outside their immediate French communities</span><span class="answer">married outside their immediate French communities</span><span class="answer">adapted quickly and often married outside their immediate French communities</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111713a58dae1900cd6c02"><p> <strong class="question">Who was one prominent Huguenot-descended arms manufacturer?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">E.I. du Pont</span><span class="answer">E.I. du Pont</span><span class="answer">E.I. du Pont</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111713a58dae1900cd6c03"><p> <strong class="question">For how long did Huguenots continue to use French names?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">into the nineteenth century</span><span class="answer">well into the nineteenth century</span><span class="answer">well into the nineteenth century</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111713a58dae1900cd6c04"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of du Pont's gunpowder operation?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Eleutherian gunpowder mills</span><span class="answer">Eleutherian gunpowder mills.</span><span class="answer">Eleutherian</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>One of the most prominent Huguenot refugees in the Netherlands was Pierre Bayle. He started teaching in Rotterdam, where he finished writing and publishing his multi-volume masterpiece, Historical and Critical Dictionary. It became one of the 100 foundational texts of the US Library of Congress. Some Huguenot descendants in the Netherlands may be noted by French family names, although they typically use Dutch given names. Due to the Huguenots' early ties with the leadership of the Dutch Revolt and their own participation, some of the Dutch patriciate are of part-Huguenot descent. Some Huguenot families have kept alive various traditions, such as the celebration and feast of their patron Saint Nicolas, similar to the Dutch Sint Nicolaas (Sinterklaas) feast.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571117d4a58dae1900cd6c0a"><p> <strong class="question">Who was a prominent Huguenot in Holland?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Pierre Bayle</span><span class="answer">Pierre Bayle</span><span class="answer">Pierre Bayle</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571117d4a58dae1900cd6c0b"><p> <strong class="question">Where did he begin teaching?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Rotterdam</span><span class="answer">Rotterdam</span><span class="answer">Rotterdam</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571117d4a58dae1900cd6c0c"><p> <strong class="question">What books did Bayle publish?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Historical and Critical Dictionary</span><span class="answer">Historical and Critical Dictionary</span><span class="answer">Historical and Critical Dictionary</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571117d4a58dae1900cd6c0d"><p> <strong class="question">These books became a foundational text for what library?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">US Library of Congress</span><span class="answer">US Library of Congress</span><span class="answer">US Library of Congress</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571117d4a58dae1900cd6c0e"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the patron saint of the Huguenots?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Saint Nicolas</span><span class="answer">Saint Nicolas</span><span class="answer">Saint Nicolas</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The French Protestant Church of London was established by Royal Charter in 1550. It is now located at Soho Square. Huguenot refugees flocked to Shoreditch, London. They established a major weaving industry in and around Spitalfields (see Petticoat Lane and the Tenterground) in East London. In Wandsworth, their gardening skills benefited the Battersea market gardens. The Old Truman Brewery, then known as the Black Eagle Brewery, was founded in 1724. The flight of Huguenot refugees from Tours, France drew off most of the workers of its great silk mills which they had built.[citation needed] Some of these immigrants moved to Norwich, which had accommodated an earlier settlement of Walloon weavers. The French added to the existing immigrant population, then comprising about a third of the population of the city.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111992b654c5140001fb43"><p> <strong class="question">What early Huguenot Church was established in England?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The French Protestant Church of London</span><span class="answer">The French Protestant Church of London</span><span class="answer">The French Protestant Church of London</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111992b654c5140001fb44"><p> <strong class="question">When was the charter for this church signed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1550</span><span class="answer">1550</span><span class="answer">1550</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111992b654c5140001fb45"><p> <strong class="question">What is the present-day location of this church?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Soho Square</span><span class="answer">Soho Square</span><span class="answer">Soho Square</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111992b654c5140001fb46"><p> <strong class="question">What London neighborhood attracted Huguenot refugees?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Shoreditch</span><span class="answer">Shoreditch</span><span class="answer">Shoreditch</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111992b654c5140001fb47"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Old Truman Brewery founded?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1724</span><span class="answer">1724</span><span class="answer">1724</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Around 1685, Huguenot refugees found a safe haven in the Lutheran and Reformed states in Germany and Scandinavia. Nearly 50,000 Huguenots established themselves in Germany, 20,000 of whom were welcomed in Brandenburg-Prussia, where they were granted special privileges (Edict of Potsdam) and churches in which to worship (such as the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Angermünde) by Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia. The Huguenots furnished two new regiments of his army: the Altpreußische Infantry Regiments No. 13 (Regiment on foot Varenne) and 15 (Regiment on foot Wylich). Another 4,000 Huguenots settled in the German territories of Baden, Franconia (Principality of Bayreuth, Principality of Ansbach), Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, Duchy of Württemberg, in the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts, in the Palatinate and Palatinate-Zweibrücken, in the Rhine-Main-Area (Frankfurt), in modern-day Saarland; and 1,500 found refuge in Hamburg, Bremen and Lower Saxony. Three hundred refugees were granted asylum at the court of George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Celle.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111ab8a58dae1900cd6c3c"><p> <strong class="question">What protestant religions made Northern European counties safe for Huguenot immigration?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Lutheran and Reformed</span><span class="answer">Lutheran and Reformed</span><span class="answer">Lutheran and Reformed</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111ab8a58dae1900cd6c3d"><p> <strong class="question">Which areas of Northern Europe practiced those religions?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Germany and Scandinavia</span><span class="answer">Germany and Scandinavia</span><span class="answer">Germany and Scandinavia</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111ab8a58dae1900cd6c3e"><p> <strong class="question">What proclamation gave Huguenots special privileges in Brandenburg?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Edict of Potsdam</span><span class="answer">Edict of Potsdam</span><span class="answer">Edict of Potsdam</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111ab8a58dae1900cd6c3f"><p> <strong class="question">What dual titles did Frederick William hold?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia</span><span class="answer">Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia</span><span class="answer">Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57111ab8a58dae1900cd6c40"><p> <strong class="question">What military impact did Huguenot immigration have on Frederick's army?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Huguenots furnished two new regiments</span><span class="answer">two new regiments</span><span class="answer">furnished two new regiments of his army</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, invited Huguenots to settle in his realms, and a number of their descendants rose to positions of prominence in Prussia.
