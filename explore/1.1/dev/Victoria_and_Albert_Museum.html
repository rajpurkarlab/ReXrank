It was founded in 1852 and named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The V&amp;A is located in the Brompton district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area that has become known as &quot;Albertopolis&quot; because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial and the major cultural institutions with which he was associated. These include the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the Royal Albert Hall. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Like other national British museums, entrance to the museum has been free since 2001.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726710b708984140094c61d"><p>

The holdings of ceramics, glass, textiles, costumes, silver, ironwork, jewellery, furniture, medieval objects, sculpture, prints and printmaking, drawings and photographs are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world. The museum owns the world's largest collection of post-classical sculpture, with the holdings of Italian Renaissance items being the largest outside Italy. The departments of Asia include art from South Asia, China, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The East Asian collections are among the best in Europe, with particular strengths in ceramics and metalwork, while the Islamic collection is amongst the largest in the Western world.

At this stage the collections covered both applied art and science. Several of the exhibits from the Exhibition were purchased to form the nucleus of the collection. By February 1854 discussions were underway to transfer the museum to the current site and it was renamed South Kensington Museum. In 1855 the German architect Gottfried Semper, at the request of Cole, produced a design for the museum, but it was rejected by the Board of Trade as too expensive. The site was occupied by Brompton Park House; this was extended including the first refreshment rooms opened in 1857, the museum being the first in the world to provide such a facility.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572685cd5951b619008f7573"><p> <strong class="question">The V&amp;A has its origins in which world exposition? </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Great Exhibition of 1851</span><span class="answer">Great Exhibition of 1851</span><span class="answer">Great Exhibition</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572685cd5951b619008f7574"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the V&amp;A's first director?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Henry Cole</span><span class="answer">Henry Cole,</span><span class="answer">Henry Cole</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572685cd5951b619008f7575"><p> <strong class="question">What was the museum originally called?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Museum of Manufactures</span><span class="answer">Museum of Manufactures</span><span class="answer">Museum of Manufactures</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572685cd5951b619008f7576"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the V&amp;A transferred to from its original location at Marlborough House?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Somerset House</span><span class="answer">Somerset House</span><span class="answer">Somerset House</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572685cd5951b619008f7577"><p> <strong class="question">Which German architect was asked to produce a design for the museum?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Gottfried Semper</span><span class="answer">Gottfried Semper</span><span class="answer">Gottfried Semper</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The official opening by Queen Victoria was on 22 June 1857. In the following year, late night openings were introduced, made possible by the use of gas lighting. This was to enable in the words of Cole &quot;to ascertain practically what hours are most convenient to the working classes&quot;—this was linked to the use of the collections of both applied art and science as educational resources to help boost productive industry. In these early years the practical use of the collection was very much emphasised as opposed to that of &quot;High Art&quot; at the National Gallery and scholarship at the British Museum. George Wallis (1811–1891), the first Keeper of Fine Art Collection, passionately promoted the idea of wide art education through the museum collections. This led to the transfer to the museum of the School of Design that had been founded in 1837 at Somerset House; after the transfer it was referred to as the Art School or Art Training School, later to become the Royal College of Art which finally achieved full independence in 1949. From the 1860s to the 1880s the scientific collections had been moved from the main museum site to various improvised galleries to the west of Exhibition Road. In 1893 the &quot;Science Museum&quot; had effectively come into existence when a separate director was appointed.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57268d02f1498d1400e8e378"><p> <strong class="question">Who officially opened the V&amp;A?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Queen Victoria</span><span class="answer">Queen Victoria</span><span class="answer">Queen Victoria</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57268d02f1498d1400e8e379"><p> <strong class="question">What is the exact date of the V&amp;A's official opening?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">22 June 1857</span><span class="answer">22 June 1857</span><span class="answer">22 June 1857</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57268d02f1498d1400e8e37a"><p> <strong class="question">Who is known as the first Keeper of Fine Art Collection at the V&amp;A?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">George Wallis</span><span class="answer">George Wallis</span><span class="answer">George Wallis</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57268d02f1498d1400e8e37b"><p> <strong class="question">The use of gas lighting made what possible the year after the museum officially opened?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">late night openings</span><span class="answer">late night openings</span><span class="answer">late night openings</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57268d02f1498d1400e8e37c"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did the Royal College of Art gained full independence from the V&amp;A?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1949</span><span class="answer">1949</span><span class="answer">1949</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Before the return of the collections after the war, the Britain Can Make It exhibition was held between September and November 1946, attracting nearly a million and a half visitors.

The V&amp;A is not contributing financially, but will be providing expertise, loans and exhibitions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269656708984140094cafd"><p> <strong class="question">The V&amp;A is looking to open a branded gallery in which city in Scotland?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Dundee</span><span class="answer">Dundee</span><span class="answer">Dundee</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269656708984140094cafe"><p> <strong class="question">What is the estimated cost of the V&amp;A branded gallery?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">£76 million</span><span class="answer">£76 million</span><span class="answer">£76 million</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269656708984140094caff"><p> <strong class="question">Where in Dundee will the gallery be located?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">on the city's waterfront</span><span class="answer">on the city's waterfront</span><span class="answer">on the city's waterfront</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269656708984140094cb00"><p> <strong class="question">What will V&amp;A Dundee focus on?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">fashion, architecture, product design, graphic arts and photography</span><span class="answer">fashion, architecture, product design, graphic arts and photography</span><span class="answer">fashion, architecture, product design, graphic arts and photography</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269656708984140094cb01"><p> <strong class="question">When could V&amp;A Dundee?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">within five years</span><span class="answer">within five years</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Victorian parts of the building have a complex history, with piecemeal additions by different architects. Founded in May 1852, it was not until 1857 that the museum moved to the present site. This area of London was known as Brompton but had been renamed South Kensington. The land was occupied by Brompton Park House, which was extended, most notably by the &quot;Brompton Boilers&quot;, which were starkly utilitarian iron galleries with a temporary look and were later dismantled and used to build the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood. The first building to be erected that still forms part of the museum was the Sheepshanks Gallery in 1857 on the eastern side of the garden. Its architect was civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke, Royal Engineers, who was appointed by Cole. The next major expansions were designed by the same architect, the Turner and Vernon galleries built 1858-9 to house the eponymous collections (later transferred to the Tate Gallery) and now used as the picture galleries and tapestry gallery respectively. The North and South Courts, were then built, both of which opened by June 1862. They now form the galleries for temporary exhibitions and are directly behind the Sheepshanks Gallery. On the very northern edge of the site is situated the Secretariat Wing, also built in 1862 this houses the offices and board room etc. and is not open to the public.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572698d7dd62a815002e8a98"><p> <strong class="question">What was the building that formerly occupied the V&amp;A's present site called?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Brompton Park House</span><span class="answer">Brompton Park House</span><span class="answer">Brompton Park House</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572698d7dd62a815002e8a99"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first building erected that still forms part of the museum?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Sheepshanks Gallery</span><span class="answer">Sheepshanks Gallery</span><span class="answer">1857</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572698d7dd62a815002e8a9a"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the Turner and Vernon galleries that were built in 1858-9?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Captain Francis Fowke</span><span class="answer">Captain Francis Fowke</span><span class="answer">Captain Francis Fowke</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572698d7dd62a815002e8a9b"><p> <strong class="question">In which year were the North and South Courts opened?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Secretariat Wing</span><span class="answer">June 1862</span><span class="answer">June 1862</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572698d7dd62a815002e8a9c"><p> <strong class="question">What does the Secretariat Wing house?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">offices and board room</span><span class="answer">houses the offices and board room etc. and is not open to the public</span><span class="answer">the offices and board room etc.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>An ambitious scheme of decoration was developed for these new areas: a series of mosaic figures depicting famous European artists of the Medieval and Renaissance period. These have now been removed to other areas of the museum. Also started were a series of frescoes by Lord Leighton: Industrial Arts as Applied to War 1878–1880 and Industrial Arts Applied to Peace, which was started but never finished. To the east of this were additional galleries, the decoration of which was the work of another designer Owen Jones, these were the Oriental Courts (covering India, China and Japan) completed in 1863, none of this decoration survives, part of these galleries became the new galleries covering the 19th century, opened in December 2006. The last work by Fowke was the design for the range of buildings on the north and west sides of the garden, this includes the refreshment rooms, reinstated as the Museum Café in 2006, with the silver gallery above, (at the time the ceramics gallery), the top floor has a splendid lecture theatre although this is seldom open to the general public. The ceramic staircase in the northwest corner of this range of buildings was designed by F. W. Moody and has architectural details of moulded and coloured pottery. All the work on the north range was designed and built in 1864–69. The style adopted for this part of the museum was Italian Renaissance, much use was made of terracotta, brick and mosaic, this north façade was intended as the main entrance to the museum with its bronze doors designed by James Gamble &amp; Reuben Townroe having six panels depicting: Humphry Davy (chemistry); Isaac Newton (astronomy); James Watt (mechanics); Bramante (architecture); Michelangelo (sculpture); Titian (painting); thus representing the range of the museums collections, Godfrey Sykes also designed the terracotta embellishments and the mosaic in the pediment of the North Façade commemorating the Great Exhibition the profits from which helped to fund the museum, this is flanked by terracotta statue groups by Percival Ball. This building replaced Brompton Park House, which could then be demolished to make way for the south range.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269c06708984140094cba1"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the designer of the Oriental Courts?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Oriental Courts</span><span class="answer">Owen Jones</span><span class="answer">Owen Jones</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269c06708984140094cba2"><p> <strong class="question">What art historical style was used in the decoration for the northern part of the museum?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Italian Renaissance</span><span class="answer">Italian Renaissance</span><span class="answer">Italian Renaissance</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269c06708984140094cba3"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the bronze doors used as the main entrance to the museum?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">James Gamble &amp; Reuben Townroe</span><span class="answer">James Gamble &amp; Reuben Townroe</span><span class="answer">James Gamble &amp; Reuben Townroe</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269c06708984140094cba4"><p> <strong class="question">What famous English physicist and mathematician was depicted in the main bronze door entrance of the museum?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Isaac Newton</span><span class="answer">Isaac Newton (astronomy</span><span class="answer">Isaac Newton</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269c06708984140094cba5"><p> <strong class="question">What Italian painter was depicted in the main bronze door entrance of the museum?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Titian</span><span class="answer">Michelangelo (sculpture)</span><span class="answer">Michelangelo</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The interiors of the three refreshment rooms were assigned to different designers.

The lower part of the walls are panelled in wood with a band of paintings depicting fruit and the occasional figure, with moulded plaster foliage on the main part of the wall and a plaster frieze around the decorated ceiling and stained-glass windows by Edward Burne-Jones. The Centre Refreshment Room 1865–77 was designed in a Renaissance style by James Gamble, the walls and even the Ionic columns are covered in decorative and moulded ceramic tile, the ceiling consists of elaborate designs on enamelled metal sheets and matching stained-glass windows, the marble fireplace was designed and sculpted by Alfred Stevens and was removed from Dorchester House prior to that building's demolition in 1929. The Grill Room 1876–81 was designed by Sir Edward Poynter, the lower part of the walls consist of blue and white tiles with various figures and foliage enclosed by wood panelling, above there are large tiled scenes with figures depicting the four seasons and the twelve months these were painted by ladies from the Art School then based in the museum, the windows are also stained glass, there is an elaborate cast-iron grill still in place.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269d68708984140094cbd7"><p> <strong class="question">Who were responsible for the interior decorations of the Green Dining Room?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Philip Webb and William Morris</span><span class="answer">Philip Webb and William Morris</span><span class="answer">Philip Webb and William Morris</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269d68708984140094cbd8"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the ceiling and stained-glass windows of the Green Dining Room?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Edward Burne-Jones</span><span class="answer">Edward Burne-Jones</span><span class="answer">Edward Burne-Jones</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269d68708984140094cbd9"><p> <strong class="question">Who was responsible for the decorations of the Centre Refreshment Room?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">James Gamble</span><span class="answer">James Gamble,</span><span class="answer">James Gamble</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269d68708984140094cbda"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed and sculpted the marble fireplace in the Centre Refreshment Room?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Alfred Stevens</span><span class="answer">Alfred Stevens</span><span class="answer">Alfred Stevens</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57269d68708984140094cbdb"><p> <strong class="question">Who was responsible for the decorations of the Grill Room?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Sir Edward Poynter</span><span class="answer">Sir Edward Poynter</span><span class="answer">Sir Edward Poynter</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With the death of Captain Francis Fowke, Royal Engineers the next architect to work at the museum was Colonel (later Major General) Henry Young Darracott Scott, also of the Royal Engineers.

W. Moody, a final embellishment were the wrought iron gates made as late as 1885 designed by Starkie Gardner, these lead to a passage through the building. Scott also designed the two Cast Courts 1870–73 to the southeast of the garden (the site of the &quot;Brompton Boilers&quot;), these vast spaces have ceilings 70 feet (21 m) in height to accommodate the plaster casts of parts of famous buildings, including Trajan's Column (in two separate pieces). The final part of the museum designed by Scott was the Art Library and what is now the sculpture gallery on the south side of the garden, built 1877–83, the exterior mosaic panels in the parapet were designed by Reuben Townroe who also designed the plaster work in the library, Sir John Taylor designed the book shelves and cases, also this was the first part of the museum to have electric lighting. This completed the northern half of the site, creating a quadrangle with the garden at its centre, but left the museum without a proper façade. In 1890 the government launched a competition to design new buildings for the museum, with architect Alfred Waterhouse as one of the judges; this would give the museum a new imposing front entrance.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a2445951b619008f7861"><p> <strong class="question">What technique was used to decorate the east side of the building?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">sgraffito</span><span class="answer">sgraffito</span><span class="answer">sgraffito</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a2445951b619008f7862"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the wrought iron gates that was used to embellish the east side of the building?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Starkie Gardner</span><span class="answer">Starkie Gardner</span><span class="answer">Starkie Gardner</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a2445951b619008f7863"><p> <strong class="question">Where on the side are the two Cast Courts located?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">southeast of the garden</span><span class="answer">the southeast of the garden (the site of the &quot;Brompton Boilers&quot;),</span><span class="answer">southeast of the garden</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a2445951b619008f7864"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the sculpture gallery now located?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Art Library</span><span class="answer">the south side of the garden</span><span class="answer">south side of the garden</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a2445951b619008f7865"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the plaster work in the Art Library?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Reuben Townroe</span><span class="answer">Reuben Townroe</span><span class="answer">Reuben Townroe</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The main façade, built from red brick and Portland stone, stretches 720 feet (220 m) along Cromwell Gardens and was designed by Aston Webb after winning a competition in 1891 to extend the museum. Construction took place between 1899 and 1909. Stylistically it is a strange hybrid, although much of the detail belongs to the Renaissance there are medieval influences at work. The main entrance consisting of a series of shallow arches supported by slender columns and niches with twin doors separated by pier is Romanesque in form but Classical in detail. Likewise the tower above the main entrance has an open work crown surmounted by a statue of fame, a feature of late Gothic architecture and a feature common in Scotland, but the detail is Classical. The main windows to the galleries are also mullioned and transomed, again a Gothic feature, the top row of windows are interspersed with statues of many of the British artists whose work is displayed in the museum.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a5b5f1498d1400e8e5fe"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the main façade that stretches along Cromwell Gardens?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Aston Webb</span><span class="answer">Aston Webb</span><span class="answer">Aston Webb</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a5b5f1498d1400e8e5ff"><p> <strong class="question">What building materials were used to build the main façade?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">red brick and Portland stone</span><span class="answer">red brick and Portland stone</span><span class="answer">red brick and Portland stone</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a5b5f1498d1400e8e600"><p> <strong class="question">How long does the main façade stretch along Cromwell Gardens?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">720 feet</span><span class="answer">720 feet</span><span class="answer">720 feet</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a5b5f1498d1400e8e601"><p> <strong class="question">What late Gothic architectural sculptural feature is found on the tower above the main entrance?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a statue of fame</span><span class="answer">statue of fame</span><span class="answer">an open work crown surmounted by a statue of fame</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a5b5f1498d1400e8e602"><p> <strong class="question">Statues of British artists adorn which part of the tower above the main entrance?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">top row of windows</span><span class="answer">top row of windows</span><span class="answer">the top row of windows</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Prince Albert appears within the main arch above the twin entrances, Queen Victoria above the frame around the arches and entrance, sculpted by Alfred Drury.

The interior makes much use of marble in the entrance hall and flanking staircases, although the galleries as originally designed were white with restrained classical detail and mouldings, very much in contrast to the elaborate decoration of the Victorian galleries, although much of this decoration was removed in the early 20th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a9ff708984140094cd4b"><p> <strong class="question">Who sculpted the representations of Prince Albert and Queen Victoria found in the main entrance?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Alfred Drury</span><span class="answer">Alfred Drury.</span><span class="answer">Alfred Drury</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a9ff708984140094cd4c"><p> <strong class="question">How many levels of galleries do the façades surround?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">four</span><span class="answer">four levels</span><span class="answer">four</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a9ff708984140094cd4d"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the Entrance Hall and Rotunda?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Alfred Drury</span><span class="answer">Webb</span><span class="answer">Webb</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a9ff708984140094cd4e"><p> <strong class="question">What building material does the entrance hall and flanking staircases use predominantly?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">marble</span><span class="answer">marble</span><span class="answer">marble</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726a9ff708984140094cd4f"><p> <strong class="question">Which British monarch appears above the frame around the arches and entrance?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Queen Victoria</span><span class="answer">Prince Albert</span><span class="answer">Queen Victoria</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the immediate post-war years there was little money available for other than essential repairs. The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. This involved flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006). Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600–1800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the façade.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ace8dd62a815002e8c9e"><p> <strong class="question">Which part of the museum received the first major post-war work?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Art Library</span><span class="answer">new storage space for books in the Art Library</span><span class="answer">new storage space for books in the Art Library</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ace8dd62a815002e8c9f"><p> <strong class="question">What did the museum acquire from the Royal College of Science?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Henry Cole wing</span><span class="answer">Henry Cole wing</span><span class="answer">Henry Cole wing</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ace8dd62a815002e8ca0"><p> <strong class="question">What was constructed between 1978 and 1982 to link the Henry Cole wing to the rest of the museum?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a new entrance building</span><span class="answer">new entrance building</span><span class="answer">a new entrance building</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ace8dd62a815002e8ca1"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the iron gates that decorate the new entrance building?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne</span><span class="answer">Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne</span><span class="answer">Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ace8dd62a815002e8ca2"><p> <strong class="question">What was intended for the site of the former boiler house?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Spiral</span><span class="answer">the Spiral,</span><span class="answer">the Spiral</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A few galleries were redesigned in the 1990s including the Indian, Japanese, Chinese, iron work, the main glass galleries and the main silverware gallery which was further enhanced in 2002 when some of the Victorian decoration was recreated. This included two of the ten columns having their ceramic decoration replaced and the elaborate painted designs restored on the ceiling. As part of the 2006 renovation the mosaic floors in the sculpture gallery were restored—most of the Victorian floors were covered in linoleum after the Second World War. After the success of the British Galleries, opened in 2001, it was decided to embark on a major redesign of all the galleries in the museum; this is known as &quot;FuturePlan&quot;, and was created in consultation with the exhibition designers and masterplanners Metaphor. The plan is expected to take about ten years and was started in 2002. To date several galleries have been redesigned, notably, in 2002: the main Silver Gallery, Contemporary; in 2003: Photography, the main entrance, The Painting Galleries; in 2004: the tunnel to the subway leading to South Kensington tube station, New signage throughout the museum, architecture, V&amp;A and RIBA reading rooms and stores, metalware, Members' Room, contemporary glass, the Gilbert Bayes sculpture gallery; in 2005: portrait miniatures, prints and drawings, displays in Room 117, the garden, sacred silver and stained glass; in 2006: Central Hall Shop, Islamic Middle East, the new café, sculpture galleries. Several designers and architects have been involved in this work. Eva Jiřičná designed the enhancements to the main entrance and rotunda, the new shop, the tunnel and the sculpture galleries. Gareth Hoskins was responsible for contemporary and architecture, Softroom, Islamic Middle East and the Members' Room, McInnes Usher McKnight Architects (MUMA) were responsible for the new Cafe and designed the new Medieval and Renaissance galleries which opened in 2009.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726afeb708984140094cdd7"><p> <strong class="question">Which gallery was redesigned in the 1990s and later improved in 2002? </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">main silverware gallery</span><span class="answer">the main glass galleries and the main silverware gallery</span><span class="answer">silverware</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726afeb708984140094cdd8"><p> <strong class="question">What was restored in the sculpture gallery during its renovated in 2006?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">mosaic floors</span><span class="answer">the mosaic floors in the sculpture gallery</span><span class="answer">mosaic floors</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726afeb708984140094cdd9"><p> <strong class="question">What was the title given to the major project to redesign all the galleries in the museum?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">FuturePlan</span><span class="answer">FuturePlan</span><span class="answer">FuturePlan</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726afeb708984140094cdda"><p> <strong class="question">A subway tunnel from the museum leads to which tube station?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">South Kensington</span><span class="answer">South Kensington</span><span class="answer">South Kensington</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726afeb708984140094cddb"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the new Medieval and Renaissance galleries which opened in 2009?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">McInnes Usher McKnight Architects</span><span class="answer">Gareth Hoskins was responsible for contemporary and architecture, Softroom, Islamic Middle East and the Members' Room, McInnes Usher McKnight Architects</span><span class="answer">McInnes Usher McKnight Architects</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The central garden was redesigned by Kim Wilkie and opened as the John Madejski Garden, on 5 July 2005.

A large scale digitization project began in 2007 in that department. That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol and to create a factory to completely digitize the collection. The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs utilizing digital cameras. The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. 15,000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. The second step of the Factory Project is to catalog everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. All of those items which were photographed and cataloged, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project. The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. There is a &quot;Search the Collections&quot; feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. The main impetus behind the large-scale digitization project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726cfa3708984140094d209"><p> <strong class="question">In which year did the V&amp;A's Word and Image Department began a large scale digitization project?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2007</span><span class="answer">2007</span><span class="answer">2007</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726cfa3708984140094d20a"><p> <strong class="question">What was the digitization project called?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Factory Project</span><span class="answer">Factory Project</span><span class="answer">the Factory Project</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726cfa3708984140094d20b"><p> <strong class="question">The title of the digitization project was a reference to which artist?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Andy Warhol</span><span class="answer">Andy Warhol</span><span class="answer">Andy Warhol</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726cfa3708984140094d20c"><p> <strong class="question">Approximately how many images were digitized during the first year of the digitization project?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">15,000</span><span class="answer">15,000</span><span class="answer">15,000</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726cfa3708984140094d20d"><p> <strong class="question">What is the second phase of the digitization project?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">to catalog everything</span><span class="answer">catalog everything</span><span class="answer">to catalog everything</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Not only the work of British artists and craftspeople is on display, but also work produced by European artists that was purchased or commissioned by British patrons, as well as imports from Asia, including porcelain, cloth and wallpaper.

For instance, design in the Tudor period was influenced by the spread of printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain. In the Stuart period, increasing trade, especially with Asia, enabled wider access to luxuries like carpets, lacquered furniture, silks and porcelain. In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure. For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies. European styles seen on the Grand Tour also influenced taste. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the growth of mass production produced entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade. In the Victorian era new technology and machinery had a significant effect on manufacturing, and for the first time since the reformation, the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches had a major effect on art and design such as the Gothic Revival. There is a large display on the Great Exhibition which, among other things, led to the founding of the V&amp;A. In the later 19th century, the increasing backlash against industrialization, led by John Ruskin, contributed to the Arts and Crafts movement.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726d7faf1498d1400e8ecdb"><p> <strong class="question">What led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies during the Georgian period?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">increase in tea drinking</span><span class="answer">increase in tea drinking</span><span class="answer">increase in tea drinking</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726d7faf1498d1400e8ecda"><p> <strong class="question">What British cultural trend during the Georgian is linked to design during the same period?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure</span><span class="answer">printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain</span><span class="answer">entertainment and leisure</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726d7faf1498d1400e8ecde"><p> <strong class="question">Who is considered the leading figure in the Arts and Crafts movement?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">John Ruskin</span><span class="answer">John Ruskin</span><span class="answer">John Ruskin</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726d7faf1498d1400e8ecdc"><p> <strong class="question">The entrepreneurs Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade were influenced by what manufacturing process developed during the Industrial Revolution?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the growth of mass production</span><span class="answer">the growth of mass production</span><span class="answer">mass production</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726d7faf1498d1400e8ecdd"><p> <strong class="question">A reaction against industrialiazation contributed to the development of what artistic movement in the late 19th centurY</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Arts and Crafts</span><span class="answer">Gothic Revival</span><span class="answer">Arts and Crafts</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>One of the most dramatic parts of the museum is the Cast Courts in the sculpture wing, comprising two large, skylighted rooms two storeys high housing hundreds of plaster casts of sculptures, friezes and tombs.

Ceramics from the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres are extensive, especially from the 18th and 19th centuries. The collection of 18th-century British porcelain is the largest and finest in the world. Examples from every factory are represented, the collections of Chelsea porcelain and Worcester Porcelain being especially fine. All the major 19th-century British factories are also represented. A major boost to the collections was the Salting Bequest made in 1909, which enriched the museum's stock of Chinese and Japanese ceramics.

One of the most important pieces in this collection is a marquetry commode by the ébéniste Jean Henri Riesener dated c1780. Other signed pieces of furniture in the collection include a bureau by Jean-François Oeben, a pair of pedestals with inlaid brass work by André Charles Boulle, a commode by Bernard Vanrisamburgh and a work-table by Martin Carlin. Other 18th-century ébénistes represented in the Museum collection include Adam Weisweiler, David Roentgen, Gilles Joubert &amp; Pierre Langlois. In 1901, Sir George Donaldson donated several pieces of art Nouveau furniture to the museum, which he had acquired the previous year at the Paris Exposition Universelle. This was criticized at the time, with the result that the museum ceased to collect contemporary items and did not do so again until the 1960s. In 1986 the Lady Abingdon collection of French Empire furniture was bequeathed by Mrs T. R. P.

The main silver gallery is divided into these areas: British silver pre-1800; British silver 1800 to 1900; modernist to contemporary silver; European silver. The collection includes the earliest known piece of English silver with a dated hallmark, a silver gilt beaker dated 1496–97. Silversmiths' whose work is represented in the collection include Paul de Lamerie and Paul Storr whose Castlereagh Inkstand dated 1817–19 is one of his finest works. The main iron work gallery covers European wrought and cast iron from the mediaeval period to the early 20th century. The master of wrought ironwork Jean Tijou is represented by both examples of his work and designs on paper. One of the largest items is the Hereford Screen, weighing nearly 8 tonnes, 10.5 metres high and 11 metres wide, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1862 for the chancel in Hereford Cathedral, from which it was removed in 1967. It was made by Skidmore &amp; Company. Its structure of timber and cast iron is embellished with wrought iron, burnished brass and copper. Much of the copper and ironwork is painted in a wide range of colours. The arches and columns are decorated with polished quartz and panels of mosaic.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ee28708984140094d656"><p> <strong class="question">The silver and gold collection of the V&amp;A is divided into which categories?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">secular and sacred</span><span class="answer">secular and sacred covering both Christian (Roman Catholic, Anglican and Greek Orthodox) and Jewish liturgical vessels and items</span><span class="answer">secular and sacred</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ee28708984140094d657"><p> <strong class="question">To which year is the earliest known piece of English silver with a dated hallmark is dated?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1496–97</span><span class="answer">1496–97</span><span class="answer">1496–97</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ee28708984140094d658"><p> <strong class="question">How many tons does the Hereford Screen weigh?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">8</span><span class="answer">8 tonnes</span><span class="answer">nearly 8</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ee28708984140094d659"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the Hereford Screen?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Sir George Gilbert Scott</span><span class="answer">Sir George Gilbert Scott</span><span class="answer">Sir George Gilbert Scott</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726ee28708984140094d655"><p> <strong class="question">Approximately how many silver and gold objects does the V&amp;A have it its collection?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">over 10,000</span><span class="answer">over 10,000</span><span class="answer">over 10,000</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>One of the rarest items in the collection is the 58 cm high Gloucester Candlestick, dated to c1110, made from gilt bronze; with highly elaborate and intricate intertwining branches containing small figures and inscriptions, it is a tour de force of bronze casting.

The conservators specialise in particular areas of conservation. Areas covered by conservator's work include &quot;preventive&quot; conservation this includes: performing surveys, assessments and providing advice on the handling of items, correct packaging, mounting and handling procedures during movement and display to reduce risk of damaging objects. Activities include controlling the museum environment (for example, temperature and light) and preventing pests (primarily insects) from damaging artefacts. The other major category is &quot;interventive&quot; conservation, this includes: cleaning and reintegration to strengthen fragile objects, reveal original surface decoration, and restore shape. Interventive treatment makes an object more stable, but also more attractive and comprehensible to the viewer. It is usually undertaken on items that are to go on public display.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57270ab9708984140094d8f7"><p> <strong class="question">Which area is responsible for the long-term preservation of the V&amp;A collections?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Conservation</span><span class="answer">Conservation</span><span class="answer">Conservation</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57270ab9708984140094d8f8"><p> <strong class="question">What two environmental conditions are controlled in the museum?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">temperature and light</span><span class="answer">temperature and light</span><span class="answer">temperature and light</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57270ab9708984140094d8f9"><p> <strong class="question">What major category of conservation result in an object that is more attractive and more comprehensible to the viewer?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">interventive</span><span class="answer">interventive</span><span class="answer">interventive</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57270ab9708984140094d8fa"><p> <strong class="question">Besides the V&amp;A's, whose collections are under the responsibility of conservators at the V&amp;A?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">V&amp;A Museum of Childhood</span><span class="answer">V&amp;A Museum of Childhood</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57270ab9708984140094d8fb"><p> <strong class="question">What type of conservation include providing advice on the handling of items?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">preventive</span><span class="answer">preventive</span><span class="answer">preventive</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/evaluate.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/model.js"></script></body></html>
