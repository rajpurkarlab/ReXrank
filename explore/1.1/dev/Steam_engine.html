Non-combustion heat sources such as solar power, nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used. The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle. In the cycle, water is heated and transforms into steam within a boiler operating at a high pressure. When expanded through pistons or turbines, mechanical work is done. The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57112686b654c5140001fbd3"><p> <strong class="question">Along with geothermal and nuclear, what is a notable non-combustion heat source?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">solar</span><span class="answer">solar power</span><span class="answer">solar power, nuclear power or geothermal energy</span><span class="answer">solar</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57112686b654c5140001fbd4"><p> <strong class="question">What ideal thermodynamic cycle analyzes the process by which steam engines work?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Rankine</span><span class="answer">Rankine cycle</span><span class="answer">Rankine cycle</span><span class="answer">Rankine cycle</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57112686b654c5140001fbd5"><p> <strong class="question">In the Rankine cycle, what does water turn into when heated?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">steam</span><span class="answer">steam</span><span class="answer">steam</span><span class="answer">steam</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57112686b654c5140001fbd6"><p> <strong class="question">At what pressure is water heated in the Rankine cycle?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">high</span><span class="answer">high</span><span class="answer">high pressure</span><span class="answer">high</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57112686b654c5140001fbd7"><p> <strong class="question">What types of engines are steam engines?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">external combustion</span><span class="answer">external combustion</span><span class="answer">external combustion engines</span><span class="answer">external combustion</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first commercially successful true engine, in that it could generate power and transmit it to a machine, was the atmospheric engine, invented by Thomas Newcomen around 1712. It was an improvement over Savery's steam pump, using a piston as proposed by Papin. Newcomen's engine was relatively inefficient, and in most cases was used for pumping water. It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder. It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible, and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable &quot;head&quot;. Water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571126dfa58dae1900cd6cb2"><p> <strong class="question">What was the first true engine that was commercially successful?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">atmospheric engine</span><span class="answer">atmospheric engine</span><span class="answer">atmospheric engine</span><span class="answer">the atmospheric engine</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571126dfa58dae1900cd6cb3"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the inventor of the atmospheric engine?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Thomas Newcomen</span><span class="answer">Thomas Newcomen</span><span class="answer">Thomas Newcomen</span><span class="answer">Thomas Newcomen</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571126dfa58dae1900cd6cb4"><p> <strong class="question">About what year was the atmospheric engine invented?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1712</span><span class="answer">around 1712</span><span class="answer">1712</span><span class="answer">1712</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571126dfa58dae1900cd6cb5"><p> <strong class="question">What was invented by Savery?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">steam pump</span><span class="answer">steam pump</span><span class="answer">steam pump</span><span class="answer">steam pump</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571126dfa58dae1900cd6cb6"><p> <strong class="question">Who conceptualized the piston?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Papin</span><span class="answer">Papin</span><span class="answer">Papin</span><span class="answer">Papin</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick in the United Kingdom and, on 21 February 1804, the world's first railway journey took place as Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway from the Pen-y-darren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon in south Wales.

The result is the multiple expansion engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free turbine engine.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113639a58dae1900cd6d18"><p> <strong class="question">How many expansion stages are used by the triple expansion engine?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">three</span><span class="answer">three or four</span><span class="answer">three</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113639a58dae1900cd6d19"><p> <strong class="question">What are engines using four expansion stages known as?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">quadruple expansion engines</span><span class="answer">quadruple</span><span class="answer">quadruple expansion engines</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113639a58dae1900cd6d1a"><p> <strong class="question">In what century was the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing system used?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">19th</span><span class="answer">19th</span><span class="answer">19th</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113639a58dae1900cd6d1b"><p> <strong class="question">What sort of engines utilized the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing system?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">marine triple expansion</span><span class="answer">marine triple expansion</span><span class="answer">marine triple expansion engines</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113639a58dae1900cd6d1c"><p> <strong class="question">What class of ships is an example of large passenger liners?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Olympic</span><span class="answer">Olympic</span><span class="answer">Olympic class</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the 1840s and 50s, there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate, variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff. The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571136b8a58dae1900cd6d22"><p> <strong class="question">Along with poppet valve gears, what type of gears utilized separate admission and exhaust valves to give ideal events?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Corliss</span><span class="answer">patent valve</span><span class="answer">Corliss</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571136b8a58dae1900cd6d23"><p> <strong class="question">Along with Stephenson and Walschaerts, what is an example of a simple motion?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Joy</span><span class="answer">Joy</span><span class="answer">Joy</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571136b8a58dae1900cd6d24"><p> <strong class="question">How is lap provided by overlapping the admission side port?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve</span><span class="answer">lengthening rubbing surfaces</span><span class="answer">lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Lead fusible plugs may be present in the crown of the boiler's firebox.

A rudimentary steam turbine device was described by Taqi al-Din in 1551 and by Giovanni Branca in 1629. Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont received patents in 1606 for fifty steam powered inventions, including a water pump for draining inundated mines. Denis Papin, a Huguenot refugee, did some useful work on the steam digester in 1679, and first used a piston to raise weights in 1690.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113c6da58dae1900cd6d32"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did the history of the steam engine begin?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">first</span><span class="answer">first century AD</span><span class="answer">first century AD</span><span class="answer">first century AD</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113c6da58dae1900cd6d33"><p> <strong class="question">Who conceptualized the aeolipile?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Hero of Alexandria</span><span class="answer">Hero of Alexandria</span><span class="answer">Hero of Alexandria</span><span class="answer">Hero of Alexandria</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113c6da58dae1900cd6d34"><p> <strong class="question">What was Hero of Alexandria's nationality?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Greek</span><span class="answer">Greek</span><span class="answer">Greek</span><span class="answer">Greek</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113c6da58dae1900cd6d35"><p> <strong class="question">Who described a steam turbine in 1629?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Giovanni Branca</span><span class="answer">Giovanni Branca</span><span class="answer">Giovanni Branca</span><span class="answer">Giovanni Branca</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113c6da58dae1900cd6d36"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont patent a water pump for draining mines?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1606</span><span class="answer">1606</span><span class="answer">1606</span><span class="answer">1606</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double and triple expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried. Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113f83b654c5140001fc29"><p> <strong class="question">What type of engines became widespread around the end of the 19th century?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">compound</span><span class="answer">compound</span><span class="answer">compound engines</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113f83b654c5140001fc2a"><p> <strong class="question">What are the stages in a compound engine called?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">expansions</span><span class="answer">expansions</span><span class="answer">expansions</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113f83b654c5140001fc2b"><p> <strong class="question">In what field were double and triple expansion engines common?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">shipping</span><span class="answer">shipping</span><span class="answer">shipping</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113f83b654c5140001fc2d"><p> <strong class="question">Along with electric motors, what power sources overtook steam engines in the 20th century?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">internal combustion engines</span><span class="answer">internal combustion engines</span><span class="answer">internal combustion engines</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57113f83b654c5140001fc2c"><p> <strong class="question">What product was notably shipped in vessels equipped with double and triple expansion engines?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">coal</span><span class="answer">coal</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam turbines starting in the late part of the 19th century. Steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines (for outputs above several hundred horsepower), have fewer moving parts, and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means. Steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century, where their efficiency, higher speed appropriate to generator service, and smooth rotation were advantages. Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines. In the United States 90% of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources. Steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571142b3a58dae1900cd6d5a"><p> <strong class="question">The use of what device represented the last major evolution of the steam engine?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">steam turbines</span><span class="answer">steam turbines</span><span class="answer">steam turbines</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571142b3a58dae1900cd6d5b"><p> <strong class="question">In what part of the 19th century were steam turbines introduced?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">late</span><span class="answer">late part</span><span class="answer">late</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571142b3a58dae1900cd6d5c"><p> <strong class="question">Above what horsepower are steam turbines usually more efficient than steam engines that use reciprocating pistons?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">several hundred</span><span class="answer">several hundred horsepower</span><span class="answer">several hundred</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571142b3a58dae1900cd6d5d"><p> <strong class="question">What percentage of electrical power in the United States is made by steam turbines?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">90</span><span class="answer">90%</span><span class="answer">90%</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571142b3a58dae1900cd6d5e"><p> <strong class="question">Most power of what sort is generated by steam turbines today?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">electric</span><span class="answer">electric</span><span class="answer">electric</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The heat required for boiling the water and supplying the steam can be derived from various sources, most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space (called variously combustion chamber, firebox).

Without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid, the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small; in steam turbines, turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 °C (the creep limit of stainless steel) and condenser temperatures are around 30 °C. This gives a theoretical Carnot efficiency of about 63% compared with an actual efficiency of 42% for a modern coal-fired power station. This low turbine entry temperature (compared with a gas turbine) is why the Rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in combined-cycle gas turbine power stations.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57114e8d50c2381900b54a5b"><p> <strong class="question">What limits the Rankine cycle's efficiency?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">working fluid</span><span class="answer">working fluid</span><span class="answer">the working fluid</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57114e8d50c2381900b54a5c"><p> <strong class="question">What is the turbine entry temperature of a steam turbine, in degrees Celsius?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">565</span><span class="answer">565 °C</span><span class="answer">565 °C</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57114e8d50c2381900b54a5d"><p> <strong class="question">What is  565 °C the creep limit of?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">stainless steel</span><span class="answer">stainless steel</span><span class="answer">stainless steel</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57114e8d50c2381900b54a5f"><p> <strong class="question">What is a turbine's theoretical Carnot efficiency?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">63%</span><span class="answer">63%</span><span class="answer">63%</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57114e8d50c2381900b54a5e"><p> <strong class="question">What is the approximate condenser temperature in a turbine?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">30 °C</span><span class="answer">30 °C</span><span class="answer">30 °C</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Steam engines can be said to have been the moving force behind the Industrial Revolution and saw widespread commercial use driving machinery in factories, mills and mines; powering pumping stations; and propelling transport appliances such as railway locomotives, ships, steamboats and road vehicles.

In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711541350c2381900b54a6f"><p> <strong class="question">Who patented a high-pressure compound engine in 1805?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Arthur Woolf</span><span class="answer">Arthur Woolf</span><span class="answer">Arthur Woolf</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711541350c2381900b54a70"><p> <strong class="question">What nationality was Arthur Woolf?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">British</span><span class="answer">British</span><span class="answer">British</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711541350c2381900b54a71"><p> <strong class="question">What is decreased by staging expansion across multiple cylinders?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">torque variability</span><span class="answer">torque variability</span><span class="answer">torque variability</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711541350c2381900b54a72"><p> <strong class="question">What needs to be larger to get the same work out of lower pressure steam?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">cylinder volume</span><span class="answer">cylinder</span><span class="answer">cylinder volume</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation (in the 1990s about 90% of the world's electric production was by use of steam turbines) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines. In electricity production, the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators, which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines. In marine service, (pioneered on the Turbinia), steam turbines with reduction gearing (although the Turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines.

The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser. The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications. In the 1990s, Rankine steam cycles generated about 90% of all electric power used throughout the world, including virtually all solar, biomass, coal and nuclear power plants.

It used condensing steam to create a vacuum which was used to raise water from below, then it used steam pressure to raise it higher. Small engines were effective though larger models were problematic. They proved only to have a limited lift height and were prone to boiler explosions. It received some use in mines, pumping stations and for supplying water wheels used to power textile machinery. An attractive feature of the Savery engine was its low cost.

The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than &quot;once-through&quot; cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115c7450c2381900b54a9d"><p> <strong class="question">What do power station steam turbines use as a cold sink in the absence of CHP?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">surface condensers</span><span class="answer">surface condensers</span><span class="answer">surface condensers</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115c7450c2381900b54a9e"><p> <strong class="question">What device is a dry cooling tower similar to?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">automobile radiator</span><span class="answer">automobile radiator</span><span class="answer">an automobile radiator</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115c7450c2381900b54a9f"><p> <strong class="question">In what sort of places are dry cooling towers used?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">where water is costly</span><span class="answer">where water is costly</span><span class="answer">locations where water is costly</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115c7450c2381900b54aa0"><p> <strong class="question">An evaporative cooling tower is also referred to as what kind of cooling tower?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">wet</span><span class="answer">wet</span><span class="answer">wet</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115c7450c2381900b54aa1"><p> <strong class="question">About how many cubic meters of make-up water is used by a 700-megawatt coal-fired power plant for evaporative cooling hourly?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">3600</span><span class="answer">3600</span><span class="answer">3600</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt’s partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill Boulton &amp; Watt were building.

The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning. The governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off, good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115dbe2419e314009555a5"><p> <strong class="question">What did Watt add to the steam engine in 1788?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">centrifugal governor</span><span class="answer">centrifugal governor</span><span class="answer">centrifugal governor</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115dbe2419e314009555a6"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Watt's partner?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Boulton</span><span class="answer">Boulton</span><span class="answer">Boulton</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115dbe2419e314009555a7"><p> <strong class="question">Where was the centrifugal governor first observed by Boulton?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">flour mill</span><span class="answer">flour mill</span><span class="answer">a flour mill</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115dbe2419e314009555a8"><p> <strong class="question">What is an examine of work that a centrifugal governor-equipped steam engine wasn't suitable for?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">cotton spinning</span><span class="answer">operations requiring constant speed</span><span class="answer">cotton spinning</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115dbe2419e314009555a9"><p> <strong class="question">What was the centrifugal governor incapable of doing?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">hold a set speed</span><span class="answer">hold a set speed</span><span class="answer">hold a set speed</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The adoption of compounding was common for industrial units, for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880; it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated.

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115ff82419e314009555c3"><p> <strong class="question">What is another term for rotors?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">rotating discs</span><span class="answer">rotating discs</span><span class="answer">rotating discs</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115ff82419e314009555c4"><p> <strong class="question">In a steam turbine, what are rotors mounted on?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">drive shaft</span><span class="answer">a drive shaft</span><span class="answer">drive shaft</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115ff82419e314009555c5"><p> <strong class="question">What is another way of referring to stators?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">static discs</span><span class="answer">static discs)</span><span class="answer">static discs</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115ff82419e314009555c6"><p> <strong class="question">What are stators attached to?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">turbine casing</span><span class="answer">turbine casing</span><span class="answer">the turbine casing</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57115ff82419e314009555c7"><p> <strong class="question">In the United States, what is a usual turbine speed with 60 Hertz of power?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">3600 revolutions per minute</span><span class="answer">3600 revolutions per minute</span><span class="answer">3600 revolutions per minute</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines.

However, most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant, so that indirectly the world's industry is still dependent on steam power. Recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover.

Many such engines have been designed, from the time of James Watt to the present day, but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production; see link at bottom of article for more details. The major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and thermal expansion; the resulting leakage made them very inefficient. Lack of expansive working, or any means of control of the cutoff is also a serious problem with many such designs.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571161092419e314009555d7"><p> <strong class="question">What is an example of a rotary engine without pistons?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Wankel</span><span class="answer">Wankel</span><span class="answer">the Wankel engine</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571161092419e314009555d8"><p> <strong class="question">What parts of a conventional reciprocating steam engine could be replaced by a pistonless rotary engine?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">cylinders and valve gear</span><span class="answer">cylinders and valve gear</span><span class="answer">cylinders and valve gear</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571161092419e314009555d9"><p> <strong class="question">Along with wear, what development makes it difficult to seal the rotors in an engine that lacks pistons?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">thermal expansion</span><span class="answer">thermal expansion</span><span class="answer">thermal expansion</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The next major step occurred when James Watt developed (1763–1775) an improved version of Newcomen's engine, with a separate condenser.

Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken.

Watt independently discovered latent heat, which was confirmed by the original discoverer Joseph Black, who also advised Watt on experimental procedures. Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure. Otherwise, the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature.

HMS Dreadnought of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711658e50c2381900b54ad5"><p> <strong class="question">The frequent availability of what substance allowed land-based steam engines to exhaust a great deal of steam?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">feed water</span><span class="answer">water</span><span class="answer">feed water</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711658e50c2381900b54ad6"><p> <strong class="question">People of what nationality invented the steam turbine?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">British</span><span class="answer">British</span><span class="answer">British</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711658e50c2381900b54ad7"><p> <strong class="question">What was an example of a type of warship that required high speed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">dreadnought battleships</span><span class="answer">dreadnought battleships</span><span class="answer">dreadnought battleships</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711658e50c2381900b54ad8"><p> <strong class="question">Other than warships, what ships typically required high speeds?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ocean liners</span><span class="answer">ocean liners</span><span class="answer">ocean liners</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711658e50c2381900b54ad9"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was HMS Dreadnought launched?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1905</span><span class="answer">1905</span><span class="answer">1905</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Virtually all nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating water to provide steam that drives a turbine connected to an electrical generator. Nuclear-powered ships and submarines either use a steam turbine directly for main propulsion, with generators providing auxiliary power, or else employ turbo-electric transmission, where the steam drives a turbo generator set with propulsion provided by electric motors. A limited number of steam turbine railroad locomotives were manufactured. Some non-condensing direct-drive locomotives did meet with some success for long haul freight operations in Sweden and for express passenger work in Britain, but were not repeated. Elsewhere, notably in the U.S.A., more advanced designs with electric transmission were built experimentally, but not reproduced. It was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has done.[citation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571166352419e314009555f1"><p> <strong class="question">What do nuclear power plants heat to create electricity?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">water</span><span class="answer">water</span><span class="answer">water</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571166352419e314009555f2"><p> <strong class="question">What does the steam generated by a nuclear power plant drive?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">turbine</span><span class="answer">turbine</span><span class="answer">a turbine connected to an electrical generator</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571166352419e314009555f3"><p> <strong class="question">In a nuclear power plant, what is the steam turbine connected to?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">electrical generator</span><span class="answer">electrical generator</span><span class="answer">a turbo generator set with propulsion provided by electric motors</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571166352419e314009555f4"><p> <strong class="question">What is it called when steam propels a turbo generator with electric motor propulsion?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">turbo-electric transmission</span><span class="answer">turbo-electric transmission,</span><span class="answer">turbo-electric transmission</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="571166352419e314009555f5"><p> <strong class="question">Where were non-condensing direct-drive locomotives notably used for fast passenger trains?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Britain</span><span class="answer">Britain</span><span class="answer">Britain</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because, when an efficient turbine is used, the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711669550c2381900b54adf"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Rankine cycle sometimes called?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">practical Carnot cycle</span><span class="answer">practical Carnot cycle</span><span class="answer">a practical Carnot cycle</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711669550c2381900b54ae0"><p> <strong class="question">Where does heat rejection occur in the Rankine cycle?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">in the condenser</span><span class="answer">in the condenser</span><span class="answer">in the condenser</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711669550c2381900b54ae1"><p> <strong class="question">What does isobaric mean?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">constant pressure</span><span class="answer">constant pressure</span><span class="answer">constant pressure</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711669550c2381900b54ae2"><p> <strong class="question">What is a term that means constant temperature?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">isothermal</span><span class="answer">isothermal</span><span class="answer">isothermal</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5711669550c2381900b54ae3"><p> <strong class="question">In the Rankine cycle, in what state is the working fluid received in the condenser?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">liquid</span><span class="answer">a liquid</span><span class="answer">gaseous</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/evaluate.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/model.js"></script></body></html>
