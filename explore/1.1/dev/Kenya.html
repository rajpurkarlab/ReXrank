Its capital and largest city is Nairobi. Kenya's territory lies on the equator and overlies the East African Rift covering a diverse and expansive terrain that extends roughly from Lake Victoria to Lake Turkana (formerly called Lake Rudolf) and further south-east to the Indian Ocean. It is bordered by Tanzania to the south, Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north-west, Ethiopia to the north and Somalia to the north-east. Kenya covers 581,309 km2 (224,445 sq mi), and had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728dab94b864d1900164f96"><p> <strong class="question">Where is Kenya located?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">in Africa</span><span class="answer">Africa</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728dab94b864d1900164f97"><p> <strong class="question">What is Kenya a founding member of?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">East African Community</span><span class="answer">East African Community</span><span class="answer">East African Community</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728dab94b864d1900164f98"><p> <strong class="question">What is the capitol of Kenya?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Nairobi</span><span class="answer">Nairobi</span><span class="answer">Nairobi</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728dab94b864d1900164f99"><p> <strong class="question">What country boarders the south of Kenya?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Tanzania</span><span class="answer">Tanzania</span><span class="answer">Tanzania</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728dab94b864d1900164f9a"><p> <strong class="question">What was the population of Kenya in 2014?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">45 million people</span><span class="answer">45 million people</span><span class="answer">approximately 45 million</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Kenya has a warm and humid tropical climate on its Indian Ocean coastline. The climate is cooler in the savannah grasslands around the capital city, Nairobi, and especially closer to Mount Kenya, which has snow permanently on its peaks. Further inland, in the Nyanza region, there is a hot and dry climate which becomes humid around Lake Victoria, the largest tropical fresh-water lake in the world. This gives way to temperate and forested hilly areas in the neighboring western region. The north-eastern regions along the border with Somalia and Ethiopia are arid and semi-arid areas with near-desert landscapes. Kenya is known for its safaris, diverse climate and geography, and expansive wildlife reserves and national parks such as the East and West Tsavo National Park, the Maasai Mara, Lake Nakuru National Park, and Aberdares National Park. Kenya has several world heritage sites such as Lamu and numerous beaches, including in Diani, Bamburi and Kilifi, where international yachting competitions are held every year.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728de0e2ca10214002da9dc"><p> <strong class="question">What type of climate does Kenya have?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a warm and humid tropical climate on its Indian Ocean coastline</span><span class="answer">warm and humid tropical climate</span><span class="answer">tropical</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728de0e2ca10214002da9dd"><p> <strong class="question">How is the climate near the savannah grasslands?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The climate is cooler</span><span class="answer">cooler</span><span class="answer">cooler</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728de0e2ca10214002da9de"><p> <strong class="question">What mountain has snow on it all year round?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Mount Kenya</span><span class="answer">Mount Kenya,</span><span class="answer">Mount Kenya</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728de0e2ca10214002da9df"><p> <strong class="question">What regions do the north-eastern part of the country boarder?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Somalia and Ethiopia</span><span class="answer">Somalia and Ethiopia</span><span class="answer">Somalia and Ethiopia</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728de0e2ca10214002da9e0"><p> <strong class="question">What is Kenya known for?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">its safaris, diverse climate and geography, and expansive wildlife reserves and national parks</span><span class="answer">safaris, diverse climate and geography</span><span class="answer">safaris, diverse climate and geography, and expansive wildlife reserves</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The African Great Lakes region, which Kenya is a part of, has been inhabited by humans since the Lower Paleolithic period. By the first millennium AD, the Bantu expansion had reached the area from West-Central Africa. The borders of the modern state consequently comprise the crossroads of the Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic areas of the continent, representing most major ethnolinguistic groups found in Africa. Bantu and Nilotic populations together constitute around 97% of the nation's residents. European and Arab presence in coastal Mombasa dates to the Early Modern period; European exploration of the interior began in the 19th century. The British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895, which starting in 1920 gave way to the Kenya Colony. Kenya obtained independence in December 1963. Following a referendum in August 2010 and adoption of a new constitution, Kenya is now divided into 47 semi-autonomous counties, governed by elected governors.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728ef8d2ca10214002daac2"><p> <strong class="question">How long has the African Great Lakes region been inhabited?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Lower Paleolithic period</span><span class="answer">since the Lower Paleolithic period</span><span class="answer">since the Lower Paleolithic period</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728ef8d2ca10214002daac3"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Bantu expansion reach the area from West-Central Africa?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">By the first millennium AD</span><span class="answer">By the first millennium AD</span><span class="answer">first millennium AD</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728ef8d2ca10214002daac4"><p> <strong class="question">Where is 97% of the population located?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Bantu and Nilotic</span><span class="answer">Bantu and Nilotic</span><span class="answer">Bantu and Nilotic</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728ef8d2ca10214002daac5"><p> <strong class="question">When did the exploration of the interior begin?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">19th century</span><span class="answer">19th century</span><span class="answer">19th century</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728ef8d2ca10214002daac6"><p> <strong class="question">When did Kenya obtain independence?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">December 1963</span><span class="answer">December 1963</span><span class="answer">December 1963</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Republic of Kenya is named after Mount Kenya.

If so, then the British may not so much have mispronounced it ('Keenya'), as misspelled it.

The annual animal migration occurs between June and September with millions of animals taking part, attracting valuable foreign tourism. Two million wildebeest migrate a distance of 2,900 kilometres (1,802 mi) from the Serengeti in neighbouring Tanzania to the Masai Mara in Kenya, in a constant clockwise fashion, searching for food and water supplies.

During excavations at Lake Turkana in 1984, paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey assisted by Kamoya Kimeu discovered the Turkana Boy, a 1.6-million-year-old fossil belonging to Homo erectus.

Malindi authorities welcomed the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in 1498.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728fea1af94a219006a9ef5"><p> <strong class="question">Where do many merchants and explorers go?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Kenyan Coast</span><span class="answer">Kenyan Coast</span><span class="answer">Kenyan Coast</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728fea1af94a219006a9ef6"><p> <strong class="question">What is an important Swahili settlement along the coast?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">City of Malindi</span><span class="answer">City of Malindi</span><span class="answer">City of Malindi</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728fea1af94a219006a9ef7"><p> <strong class="question">When was the City of Malindi established?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">14th century</span><span class="answer">14th century</span><span class="answer">14th century</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the governors of British East Africa (as the Protectorate was generally known) and German East Africa agreed a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities. Lt Col Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck took command of the German military forces, determined to tie down as many British resources as possible. Completely cut off from Germany, von Lettow conducted an effective guerrilla warfare campaign, living off the land, capturing British supplies, and remaining undefeated. He eventually surrendered in Northern Rhodesia (today Zambia) fourteen days after the Armistice was signed in 1918.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729024f1d04691400778f5f"><p> <strong class="question">When was the outbreak of World War I?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">August 1914</span><span class="answer">August 1914</span><span class="answer">August 1914</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729024f1d04691400778f60"><p> <strong class="question">What two governors agreed to a truce to protect their young colonies?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">governors of British East Africa (as the Protectorate was generally known) and German East Africa</span><span class="answer">British East Africa (as the Protectorate was generally known) and German East Africa</span><span class="answer">British East Africa (as the Protectorate was generally known) and German East Africa</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729024f1d04691400778f61"><p> <strong class="question">Who was in command of the German military forces?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Lt Col Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck</span><span class="answer">Lt Col Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck</span><span class="answer">Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729024f1d04691400778f62"><p> <strong class="question">How did von Lettow conduct his group?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">effective guerrilla warfare campaign, living off the land, capturing British supplies, and remaining undefeated</span><span class="answer">guerrilla warfare campaign</span><span class="answer">guerrilla warfare</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729024f1d04691400778f63"><p> <strong class="question">Where did von Lettow surrender at?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Northern Rhodesia</span><span class="answer">Northern Rhodesia</span><span class="answer">Northern Rhodesia</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The central highlands were already home to over a million members of the Kikuyu people, most of whom had no land claims in European terms and lived as itinerant farmers.

Operation Anvil opened on 24 April 1954, after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the War Council. The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege, and the occupants were screened and the Mau Mau supporters moved to detention camps. The Home Guard formed the core of the government's strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans, not foreign forces like the British Army and King's African Rifles. By the end of the emergency, the Home Guard had killed 4,686 Mau Mau, amounting to 42% of the total insurgents. The capture of Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956 in Nyeri signified the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the military offensive. During this period, substantial governmental changes to land tenure occurred. The most important of these was the Swynnerton Plan, which was used to both reward loyalists and punish Mau Mau.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729046aaf94a219006a9f4d"><p> <strong class="question">When was Waruhiu Itote captured?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">15 January 1954</span><span class="answer">15 January 1954</span><span class="answer">15 January 1954</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729046aaf94a219006a9f4e"><p> <strong class="question">What did this help accomplish?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure</span><span class="answer">better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure</span><span class="answer">a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729046aaf94a219006a9f4f"><p> <strong class="question">When did Operation Anvil open?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">24 April 1954</span><span class="answer">24 April 1954</span><span class="answer">24 April 1954</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729046aaf94a219006a9f50"><p> <strong class="question">How many of the Mau Mau did Home Gaurd kill?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">4,686 Mau Mau</span><span class="answer">4,686</span><span class="answer">4,686</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729046aaf94a219006a9f51"><p> <strong class="question">What was the most important governmental change to land tenure?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Swynnerton Plan, which was used to both reward loyalists and punish Mau Mau.</span><span class="answer">Swynnerton Plan</span><span class="answer">Swynnerton Plan</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first direct elections for native Kenyans to the Legislative Council took place in 1957. Despite British hopes of handing power to &quot;moderate&quot; local rivals, it was the Kenya African National Union (KANU) of Jomo Kenyatta that formed a government. The Colony of Kenya and the Protectorate of Kenya each came to an end on 12 December 1963 with independence being conferred on all of Kenya. The United Kingdom ceded sovereignty over the Colony of Kenya and, under an agreement dated 8 October 1963, the Sultan of Zanzibar agreed that simultaneous with independence for the Colony of Kenya, the Sultan would cease to have sovereignty over the Protectorate of Kenya so that all of Kenya would be one sovereign, independent state. In this way, Kenya became an independent country under the Kenya Independence Act 1963 of the United Kingdom.

The elections were seen to have been flawed with international observers saying that they were below international standards. After a split which took a crucial 8% of the votes away from the ODM to the newly formed Orange Democratic Movement-Kenya (ODM-K)'s candidate, Kalonzo Musyoka, the race tightened between ODM candidate Raila Odinga and Kibaki. As the count came into the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK) headquarters, Odinga was shown to have a slight, and then substantial lead as the results from his strongholds came in early. As the ECK continued to count the votes, Kibaki closed the gap and then overtook his opponent by a substantial margin after votes from his stronghold arrived later.

Kenya is usually classified as a frontier market or occasionally an emerging market, but it is not one of the least developed countries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572916f16aef051400154a56"><p> <strong class="question">What is Kenya's HDI?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">0.519, ranked 145 out of 186 in the world</span><span class="answer">0.519</span><span class="answer">0.519</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572916f16aef051400154a57"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the biggest and most advanced economy in east and central Africa?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Kenya</span><span class="answer">Kenya</span><span class="answer">Kenya</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572916f16aef051400154a58"><p> <strong class="question">How much does 17.7% of the population live on a day?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">less than $1.25 a day</span><span class="answer">less than $1.25</span><span class="answer">less than $1.25</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572916f16aef051400154a59"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of market is Kenya considered?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a frontier market or occasionally an emerging market</span><span class="answer">frontier</span><span class="answer">frontier</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>East and Central Africa's biggest economy has posted tremendous growth in the service sector, boosted by rapid expansion in telecommunication and financial activity over the last decade, and now[when?] contributes 62% of GDP. 22% of GDP still comes from the unreliable agricultural sector which employs 75% of the labour force (a consistent characteristic of under-developed economies that have not attained food security – an important catalyst of economic growth) A small portion of the population relies on food aid.[citation needed] Industry and manufacturing is the smallest sector, accounting for 16% of GDP.

The tourism sector has exhibited steady growth in most years since independence and by the late 1980s had become the country's principal source of foreign exchange. Tourists, the largest number being from Germany and the United Kingdom, are attracted mainly to the coastal beaches and the game reserves, notably, the expansive East and West Tsavo National Park 20,808 square kilometres (8,034 sq mi) in the southeast. Tourism has seen a substantial revival over the past several years and is the major contributor to the pick-up in the country's economic growth. Tourism is now Kenya's largest foreign exchange earning sector, followed by flowers, tea, and coffee. In 2006 tourism generated US$803 million, up from US$699 million the previous year. Presently, there are also numerous Shopping Malls in Kenya. In addition, there are four main hypermarket chains in Kenya.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572917ff6aef051400154a5e"><p> <strong class="question">How much does the services sector contribute to GDP?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">61%</span><span class="answer">61%</span><span class="answer">61%</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572917ff6aef051400154a5f"><p> <strong class="question">What is the service sector dominated by?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">tourism</span><span class="answer">tourism</span><span class="answer">tourism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572917ff6aef051400154a60"><p> <strong class="question">Has the tourism sector had growth or reduction?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">steady growth</span><span class="answer">growth</span><span class="answer">growth</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572917ff6aef051400154a62"><p> <strong class="question">What attracts the tourists to Kenya?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the coastal beaches and the game reserves</span><span class="answer">coastal beaches and the game reserves,</span><span class="answer">coastal beaches and the game reserves</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572917ff6aef051400154a61"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the largest number of tourist coming from?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Germany and the United Kingdom</span><span class="answer">Germany and the United Kingdom</span><span class="answer">Germany and the United Kingdom</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Agriculture is the second largest contributor to Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP), after the service sector.

Pigeon peas are very drought resistant, so can be grown in areas with less than 650 mm annual rainfall. Successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes, by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing. This work, which included linking producers to wholesalers, helped to increase local producer prices by 20–25% in Nairobi and Mombasa. The commercialisation of the pigeon pea is now enabling some farmers to buy assets, ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock, and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57291a7b1d0469140077903f"><p> <strong class="question">What institution has helped farmers grow new pigeon pea varieties?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)</span><span class="answer">ICRISAT</span><span class="answer">International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57291a7b1d04691400779040"><p> <strong class="question">Why did they teach them to grow peas?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Pigeon peas are very drought resistant,</span><span class="answer">drought resistant</span><span class="answer">very drought resistant</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57291a7b1d04691400779041"><p> <strong class="question">How did the project encourage the commercialisation of legumes?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing</span><span class="answer">stimulating the growth of local seed production</span><span class="answer">stimulating the growth of local seed production</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57291a7b1d04691400779042"><p> <strong class="question">How did this effect the producer prices?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">, helped to increase local producer prices by 20–25%</span><span class="answer">increase local producer prices by 20–25%</span><span class="answer">increase</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57291a7b1d04691400779043"><p> <strong class="question">What has the increase of prices caused?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">enabling some farmers to buy assets</span><span class="answer">enabling some farmers to buy assets</span><span class="answer">enabling some farmers to buy assets</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands, one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa.

Unfortunately, the country has not attained the level of investment and efficiency in agriculture that can guarantee food security and coupled with resulting poverty (53% of the population lives below the poverty line), a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid. Poor roads, an inadequate railway network, under-used water transport and expensive air transport have isolated mostly arid and semi-arid areas and farmers in other regions often leave food to rot in the fields because they cannot access markets.

The 200-page Action Plan, developed with support from the Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network, sets out the Government of Kenya's vision for a 'low carbon climate resilient development pathway'. At the launch in March 2013, the Secretary of the Ministry of Planning, National Development and Vision 2030 emphasised that climate will be a central issue in the renewed Medium Term Plan that will be launched in the coming months.

The Kenyan Ministry of Sports has tried to stop the defections, but they have continued anyway, with Bernard Lagat the latest, choosing to represent the United States. Most of these defections occur because of economic or financial factors.

However, its dominance has been eroded by wrangles within the now defunct Kenya Football Federation, leading to a suspension by FIFA which was lifted in March 2007.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729293d3f37b3190047809f"><p> <strong class="question">What sport has Kenyan women been a dominate force?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">women's volleyball within Africa</span><span class="answer">volleyball</span><span class="answer">volleyball</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729293d3f37b319004780a0"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most successful team sport in Kenya?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Cricket</span><span class="answer">Cricket</span><span class="answer">Cricket</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729293d3f37b319004780a1"><p> <strong class="question">When did Kenya reach the semi-finals?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2003</span><span class="answer">2003</span><span class="answer">2003</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729293d3f37b319004780a2"><p> <strong class="question">Who is the current captian of the cricket team?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Rakep Patel</span><span class="answer">Rakep Patel</span><span class="answer">Rakep Patel</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5729293d3f37b319004780a3"><p> <strong class="question">When was the suspension by FIFA lifted?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">March 2007</span><span class="answer">March 2007</span><span class="answer">March 2007</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the motor rallying arena, Kenya is home to the world famous Safari Rally, commonly acknowledged as one of the toughest rallies in the world. It was a part of the World Rally Championship for many years until its exclusion after the 2002 event owing to financial difficulties. Some of the best rally drivers in the world have taken part in and won the rally, such as Björn Waldegård, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi Mäkinen, Shekhar Mehta, Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae. Although the rally still runs annually as part of the Africa rally championship, the organisers are hoping to be allowed to rejoin the World Rally championship in the next couple of years.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57292994af94a219006aa131"><p> <strong class="question">What is Kenya the home of?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the world famous Safari Rally</span><span class="answer">Safari Rally</span><span class="answer">world famous Safari Rally</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57292994af94a219006aa132"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Safair Rally known as?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">one of the toughest rallies in the world</span><span class="answer">toughest rallies in the world</span><span class="answer">toughest rallies in the world.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57292994af94a219006aa133"><p> <strong class="question">Who are some of the best rally drivers that have won the rally?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Björn Waldegård, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi Mäkinen, Shekhar Mehta, Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae</span><span class="answer">Björn Waldegård, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi Mäkinen, Shekhar Mehta, Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae</span><span class="answer">Björn Waldegård, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi Mäkinen, Shekhar Mehta, Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Kenyans generally have three meals in a day – breakfast in the morning (kiamsha kinywa), lunch in the afternoon (chakula cha mchana) and supper in the evening (chakula cha jioni or known simply as &quot;chajio&quot;). In between, they have the 10 o'clock tea (chai ya saa nne) and 4 pm tea (chai ya saa kumi). Breakfast is usually tea or porridge with bread, chapati, mahamri, boiled sweet potatoes or yams. Ugali with vegetables, sour milk, meat, fish or any other stew is generally eaten by much of the population for lunch or supper.
