This concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth, largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the Bell System. The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) (NPL) in the late 1960s. Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe in the decade following, including the incorporation of the concept in the early ARPANET in the United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725d34089a1e219009abf50"><p> <strong class="question">What did Paul Baran develop </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching</span><span class="answer">the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching</span><span class="answer">Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725d34089a1e219009abf51"><p> <strong class="question">What did Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching do</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages</span><span class="answer">provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages</span><span class="answer">fault-tolerant, efficient routing method</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725d34089a1e219009abf52"><p> <strong class="question">What did this concept contradict </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">This concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth</span><span class="answer">theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth</span><span class="answer">principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725d34089a1e219009abf53"><p> <strong class="question">What is Donald Davies credited with </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe</span><span class="answer">coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks</span><span class="answer">coining the modern name packet switching</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572632ceec44d21400f3dc2f"><p> <strong class="question">What did Paul Baran develop in the late 1950's</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching</span><span class="answer">the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching</span><span class="answer">Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572632ceec44d21400f3dc30"><p> <strong class="question">What was the goal of the system </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages</span><span class="answer">provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572632ceec44d21400f3dc31"><p> <strong class="question">Who is credited with the modern name for this system </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe</span><span class="answer">Donald Davies</span><span class="answer">Donald Davies</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching, a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes.

The packets are routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery. Each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet. This precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination, but means that much more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger, and this information needs to be looked up in power-hungry content-addressable memory. Each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes; potentially, the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection-oriented system has to do in connection set-up, but with less information as to the application's requirements. At the destination, the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence number.

The packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking. Address information is only transferred to each node during the connection set-up phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes. The signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters. Acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated. Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table. The packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number, which is different for different packets.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726398589a1e219009ac58b"><p> <strong class="question">Is the packet header long </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number</span><span class="answer">The packet header can be small</span><span class="answer">small</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726398589a1e219009ac58a"><p> <strong class="question">Why is the node requiered to look up </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table</span><span class="answer">the connection id in a table</span><span class="answer">connection id</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726398589a1e219009ac589"><p> <strong class="question">What is a connection identifier </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking</span><span class="answer">negotiated between endpoints</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5726398589a1e219009ac588"><p> <strong class="question">What does connection orientation require</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication</span><span class="answer">a setup phase in each involved node</span><span class="answer">setup phase</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Both X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations. But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. &lt;Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991&gt; &lt;Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998&gt; &lt;Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001&gt; &lt; Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995&gt;</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57263b1638643c19005ad333"><p> <strong class="question">WHat do x.25 and Frame Relay both require</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">connection-oriented operations.

Before the introduction of X.25 in 1973, about twenty different network technologies had been developed. Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core. In the datagram system, the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is an example of a datagram protocol. In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host. This results in a simpler host interface with less functionality than in the datagram model. The X.25 protocol suite uses this network type.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7b"><p> <strong class="question">WHen did ARPNET and SITA become operational</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1969</span><span class="answer">1969</span><span class="answer">1969</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7c"><p> <strong class="question">2 differences betwen X.25 and ARPNET CITA technologies </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core</span><span class="answer">the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core.</span><span class="answer">division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7d"><p> <strong class="question">WHat does UserDatagram Protocol gaurentee</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host</span><span class="answer">sequenced delivery of data to the host</span><span class="answer">sequenced delivery of data</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7e"><p> <strong class="question">X.25 uses what type network type </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">User Datagram Protocol</span><span class="answer">the datagram model</span><span class="answer">UDP</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>AppleTalk was a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by Apple Inc. in 1985 for Apple Macintosh computers.

Users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated async connections. The business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies (mostly banks and airlines) to build their own dedicated networks. The private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network. Tymnet was also connected to dozens of other public networks in the U.S. and internationally via X.25/X.75 gateways. (Interesting note: Tymnet was not named after Mr. Tyme.
