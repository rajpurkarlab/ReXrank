Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56ddde6b9a695914005b9628"><p> <strong class="question">In what country is Normandy located?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">France</span><span class="answer">France</span><span class="answer">France</span><span class="answer">France</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56ddde6b9a695914005b9629"><p> <strong class="question">When were the Normans in Normandy?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">10th and 11th centuries</span><span class="answer">in the 10th and 11th centuries</span><span class="answer">10th and 11th centuries</span><span class="answer">10th and 11th centuries</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56ddde6b9a695914005b962a"><p> <strong class="question">From which countries did the Norse originate?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Denmark, Iceland and Norway</span><span class="answer">Denmark, Iceland and Norway</span><span class="answer">Denmark, Iceland and Norway</span><span class="answer">Denmark, Iceland and Norway</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56ddde6b9a695914005b962b"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the Norse leader?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Rollo</span><span class="answer">Rollo</span><span class="answer">Rollo</span><span class="answer">Rollo</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56ddde6b9a695914005b962c"><p> <strong class="question">What century did the Normans first gain their separate identity?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">10th century</span><span class="answer">the first half of the 10th century</span><span class="answer">10th</span><span class="answer">10th</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56dddf4066d3e219004dad5f"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the duke in the battle of Hastings?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">William the Conqueror</span><span class="answer">William the Conqueror</span><span class="answer">William the Conqueror</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56dddf4066d3e219004dad60"><p> <strong class="question">Who ruled the duchy of Normandy</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Richard I</span><span class="answer">Richard I</span><span class="answer">Richard I</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56dddf4066d3e219004dad61"><p> <strong class="question">What religion were the Normans</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Catholic</span><span class="answer">Catholic orthodoxy</span><span class="answer">Catholic</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The English name &quot;Normans&quot; comes from the French words Normans/Normanz, plural of Normant, modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann &quot;Northman&quot; or directly from Old Norse Norðmaðr, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean &quot;Norseman, Viking&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56dde0379a695914005b9636"><p> <strong class="question">What is the original meaning of the word Norman?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Viking</span><span class="answer">Norseman, Viking</span><span class="answer">Norseman, Viking</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56dde0379a695914005b9637"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Latin version of the word Norman first recorded?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">9th century</span><span class="answer">9th century</span><span class="answer">9th century</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the course of the 10th century, the initially destructive incursions of Norse war bands into the rivers of France evolved into more permanent encampments that included local women and personal property.

The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine.

Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry, and by 1066 Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation.

The Normans fought so valiantly that Prince Guaimar III begged them to stay, but they refused and instead offered to tell others back home of the prince's request.

Roussel de Bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in Asia Minor with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the Byzantine general Alexius Komnenos.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56de0ffd4396321400ee258d"><p> <strong class="question">When did Herve serve as a Byzantine general?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1050s</span><span class="answer">in the 1050s</span><span class="answer">in the 1050s</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56de0ffd4396321400ee258e"><p> <strong class="question">When did Robert Crispin go up against the Turks?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1060s</span><span class="answer">In the 1060s</span><span class="answer">In the 1060s</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56de0ffd4396321400ee258f"><p> <strong class="question">Who ruined Roussel de Bailleul's plans for an independent state?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Alexius Komnenos</span><span class="answer">Alexius Komnenos</span><span class="answer">Alexius Komnenos</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenians vassal-states of Sassoun and Taron in far eastern Anatolia.

Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and Butrint in 1085, after the death of Robert.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56de148dcffd8e1900b4b5bc"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the count of Apulia </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Robert Guiscard</span><span class="answer">Robert Guiscard</span><span class="answer">Robert Guiscard</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56de148dcffd8e1900b4b5bd"><p> <strong class="question">When did Dyrrachium  fall to the Normans?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1082</span><span class="answer">February 1082</span><span class="answer">February 1082</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56de148dcffd8e1900b4b5be"><p> <strong class="question">How many men were in Robert's army?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">30,000</span><span class="answer">30,000</span><span class="answer">30,000</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A few years after the First Crusade, in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail.

Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their surnames. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County Wexford where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names such as Furlong predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell) derived from the French Norman name Morel. Other names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) indicate Norman ancestry. These included Fitzgerald, FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, Fitzmaurice.

Scottish families of the names Bruce, Gray, Ramsay, Fraser, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and Gordon to name but a few, and including the later royal House of Stewart, can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56de3cd0cffd8e1900b4b6be"><p> <strong class="question">Who did Alexander I marry?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Sybilla of Normandy</span><span class="answer">Sybilla of Normandy</span><span class="answer">Sybilla</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56de3cd0cffd8e1900b4b6bf"><p> <strong class="question">What culture's arrival in Scotland is know as the &quot;Davidian Revolution&quot;?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Norman</span><span class="answer">Norman</span><span class="answer">Norman</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Even before the Norman Conquest of England, the Normans had come into contact with Wales.

The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this &quot;renaissance&quot; of Norman art and scholarship were Mont-Saint-Michel, Fécamp, Jumièges, Bec, Saint-Ouen, Saint-Evroul, and Saint-Wandrille. These centres were in contact with the so-called &quot;Winchester school&quot;, which channeled a pure Carolingian artistic tradition to Normandy.

In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears. Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with Arabic inscriptions. Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of ivorywork in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination. Finally should be noted the intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56de51244396321400ee27ef"><p> <strong class="question">What is the most important type of Norman art preserved in churches?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">mosaics</span><span class="answer">mosaics</span><span class="answer">mosaics</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Normandy was the site of several important developments in the history of classical music in the 11th century. Fécamp Abbey and Saint-Evroul Abbey were centres of musical production and education. At Fécamp, under two Italian abbots, William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught. It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today. Also at Fécamp, the staff, around which neumes were oriented, was first developed and taught in the 11th century. Under the German abbot Isembard, La Trinité-du-Mont became a centre of musical composition.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56de51c64396321400ee27f7"><p> <strong class="question">In what century did important classical music developments occur in Normandy?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">11th</span><span class="answer">the 11th</span><span class="answer">11th</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="56de51c64396321400ee27f8"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the two abbots at Fécamp Abbey?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna</span><span class="answer">William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna</span><span class="answer">William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At Saint Evroul, a tradition of singing had developed and the choir achieved fame in Normandy.
