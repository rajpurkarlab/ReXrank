First conceived during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man Project Mercury which put the first Americans in space, Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal of &quot;landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth&quot; by the end of the 1960s, which he proposed in a May 25, 1961, address to Congress. Project Mercury was followed by the two-man Project Gemini (1962–66).

Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the Apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which disabled the command spacecraft's propulsion and life support. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the Lunar Module as a &quot;lifeboat&quot; for these functions.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725b64d89a1e219009abd40"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did the Apollo 1 cabin fire occur?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1967</span><span class="answer">1967</span><span class="answer">1967</span><span class="answer">1967</span><span class="answer">1967</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725b64d89a1e219009abd41"><p> <strong class="question">What type of launch was happening during the Apollo 1 incident?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">prelaunch test</span><span class="answer">prelaunch</span><span class="answer">prelaunch test</span><span class="answer">prelaunch test</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725b64d89a1e219009abd42"><p> <strong class="question">What forced the cancellations of three future landings?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Budget cuts</span><span class="answer">oxygen tank explosion</span><span class="answer">Budget cuts</span><span class="answer">Budget cuts</span><span class="answer">Budget cuts</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725b64d89a1e219009abd43"><p> <strong class="question">How many of the remaining launches were successful?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Five</span><span class="answer">six</span><span class="answer">Five</span><span class="answer">Five</span><span class="answer">Five of the remaining six missions</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725b64d89a1e219009abd44"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to Apollo 13?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon</span><span class="answer">disabled the command spacecraft's propulsion and life support</span><span class="answer">oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon</span><span class="answer">oxygen tank explosion</span><span class="answer">oxygen tank explosion in transit</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones.

The program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's current human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center.

Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the &quot;missile gap&quot; that he and many other senators felt had formed between the Soviets and themselves due to the inaction of President Eisenhower. Beyond military power, Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US not &quot;first but, first and, first if, but first period.&quot; Despite Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president. He knew little about the technical details of the space program, and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing. When Kennedy's newly appointed NASA Administrator James E.

Golovin in July 1961, to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision. This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR —as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work— played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR. The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing in June 1962.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725c604271a42140099d185"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the committee established by Seaman?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Nicholas E.

In the midst of these plans, von Braun was transferred from the Army to NASA, and made Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center. The initial direct ascent plan to send the three-man Apollo Command/Service Module directly to the lunar surface, on top of a large descent rocket stage, would require a Nova-class launcher, with a lunar payload capability of over 180,000 pounds (82,000 kg). The June 11, 1962, decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the Saturn V to replace the Nova, and the MSFC proceeded to develop the Saturn rocket family for Apollo.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725d01989a1e219009abf28"><p> <strong class="question">Who had worked on the Saturn series even before the Apollo program began officially?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Wernher von Braun</span><span class="answer">Wernher von Braun</span><span class="answer">Wernher von Braun</span><span class="answer">Wernher von Braun</span><span class="answer">Wernher von Braun</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725d01989a1e219009abf29"><p> <strong class="question">From where was von Braun transferred to go to NASA?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Army</span><span class="answer">Army</span><span class="answer">Army</span><span class="answer">Army</span><span class="answer">Army</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725d01989a1e219009abf2b"><p> <strong class="question">When was the decision made to replace the Nova rockets with the Saturn V?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">June 11, 1962</span><span class="answer">1962</span><span class="answer">June 11, 1962</span><span class="answer">June 11, 1962</span><span class="answer">June 11, 1962</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water.

The list of types covered follow-on lunar exploration to include H lunar landings, I for lunar orbital survey missions, and J for extended-stay lunar landings.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725df1838643c19005ace15"><p> <strong class="question">What type of missions were approved by Mueller after the incident?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">sequence</span><span class="answer">manned lunar landing.</span><span class="answer">had to be successfully accomplished</span><span class="answer">sequence of mission types</span><span class="answer">sequence</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725df1838643c19005ace16"><p> <strong class="question">What had to happen to each mission before they would continue on to the next mission?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">successful</span><span class="answer">successfully accomplished</span><span class="answer">successfully accomplished</span><span class="answer">successfully accomplished</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725df1838643c19005ace17"><p> <strong class="question">Since NASA didn't know how many attempts each test would end up requiring, what did they use instead of numbers for the trials?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">letters</span><span class="answer">letters</span><span class="answer">letters were used instead of numbers</span><span class="answer">letters</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The delay in the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA to catch up on man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed. This was followed on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e08389a1e219009ac010"><p> <strong class="question">What was the technical name of the first unmanned Saturn V flight, Apollo 4?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">AS-501</span><span class="answer">AS-501</span><span class="answer">AS-501</span><span class="answer">AS-501</span><span class="answer">AS-501</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e08389a1e219009ac011"><p> <strong class="question">What was one thing that was specifically tested on the Apollo 4 test launch regarding the CM?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">heat shield</span><span class="answer">Service Module engine</span><span class="answer">heat shield</span><span class="answer">capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry</span><span class="answer">capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e08389a1e219009ac012"><p> <strong class="question">When was Apollo 6, or AS-502, tested?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">April 4, 1968</span><span class="answer">1968</span><span class="answer">April 4, 1968</span><span class="answer">April 4, 1968</span><span class="answer">April 4, 1968</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e08389a1e219009ac013"><p> <strong class="question">What was cancelled by NASA after the Apollo 6 testing, after deeming the Saturn V ready to hold men?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">third unmanned test</span><span class="answer">Apollo 6</span><span class="answer">third unmanned test</span><span class="answer">cancelling a third unmanned test</span><span class="answer">third unmanned test.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Apollo 5 (AS-204) was the first unmanned test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1.

In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time. Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission. This would keep the program on track. The Soviet Union had sent animals around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboard Zond 5, and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts. The decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of Apollo 7. Gemini veterans Frank Borman and James Lovell, and rookie William Anders captured the world's attention by making 10 lunar orbits in 20 hours, transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on Christmas Eve, and returning safely to Earth.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e28f38643c19005ace23"><p> <strong class="question">What type of Saturn was originally going to be used for Apollo 8?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">two Saturn IBs</span><span class="answer">V</span><span class="answer">two Saturn IBs</span><span class="answer">Saturn V</span><span class="answer">two Saturn IBs</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e28f38643c19005ace24"><p> <strong class="question">What spacecraft did the Soviets use to send animals to space and around the moon's orbit?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Zond 5</span><span class="answer">Zond 5</span><span class="answer">Zond 5</span><span class="answer">Zond 5</span><span class="answer">Zond 5</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e28f38643c19005ace25"><p> <strong class="question">On what day were images of the moon's surface transmitted to Earth via television images?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Christmas Eve</span><span class="answer">Christmas Eve</span><span class="answer">Christmas Eve</span><span class="answer">Christmas Eve</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e28f38643c19005ace26"><p> <strong class="question">What did Low suggest using Apollo 8 for instead of simply orbiting the Earth's surface?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">orbit the Moon</span><span class="answer">orbit the Moon</span><span class="answer">to orbit the Moon</span><span class="answer">orbit the Moon</span><span class="answer">orbit the Moon</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e28f38643c19005ace27"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Soviets intend to use in spacecraft after the success of Zond 5?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">human cosmonauts</span><span class="answer">human cosmonauts</span><span class="answer">human cosmonauts</span><span class="answer">human cosmonauts</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The G mission was achieved on Apollo 11 in July 1969 by an all-Gemini veteran crew consisting of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin.

Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e6f6ec44d21400f3d729"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to the Apollo 13 crew to force them to use the LM as a &quot;life boat&quot; as it had been designed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">liquid oxygen tank exploded</span><span class="answer">liquid oxygen tank exploded,</span><span class="answer">liquid oxygen tank exploded</span><span class="answer">liquid oxygen tank exploded</span><span class="answer">liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the Service Module</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e6f6ec44d21400f3d72a"><p> <strong class="question">Along with one veteran, what other two types of crew could be included in lieu of veterans after the successful landings of Apollo 11 and 12?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">rookies</span><span class="answer">Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise</span><span class="answer">two rookies</span><span class="answer">rookies</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e6f6ec44d21400f3d72b"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to the Apollo program in for the rest of 1970 after the incident regarding Apollo 13?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">grounded</span><span class="answer">oxygen tank was redesigned</span><span class="answer">grounded</span><span class="answer">Apollo was grounded</span><span class="answer">grounded</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e6f6ec44d21400f3d72c"><p> <strong class="question">What was redesigned during the Apollo program being grounded during 1970?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">oxygen tank</span><span class="answer">oxygen tank</span><span class="answer">oxygen tank</span><span class="answer">oxygen tank</span><span class="answer">oxygen tank</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725e6f6ec44d21400f3d72d"><p> <strong class="question">What month and year was Apollo 13 launched?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">April 1970</span><span class="answer">April</span><span class="answer">April 1970</span><span class="answer">April 1970</span><span class="answer">April 1970,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>About the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C.

As such, they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the Solar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission. This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite, and is believed to be representative of the highland crust. A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered, which has no known terrestrial counterpart. KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see lunar magma ocean).</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725ea6889a1e219009ac09e"><p> <strong class="question">How did the rocks on the moon compare to those on Earth?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">extremely old</span><span class="answer">old</span><span class="answer">extremely old</span><span class="answer">extremely old</span><span class="answer">old</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725ea6889a1e219009ac09f"><p> <strong class="question">How old were some of the oldest rock samples found on the moon?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">4.6 billion years</span><span class="answer">4.6 billion years</span><span class="answer">.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust</span><span class="answer">4.6 billion</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725ea6889a1e219009ac0a0"><p> <strong class="question">What new component was found in certain rocks from the moon?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">KREEP</span><span class="answer">calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite,</span><span class="answer">anorthite</span><span class="answer">feldspar mineral anorthite</span><span class="answer">KREEP</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725ea6889a1e219009ac0a1"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of the rock found during the Apollo 15 mission that KREEP was discovered in?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Genesis Rock</span><span class="answer">Genesis</span><span class="answer">Genesis Rock</span><span class="answer">Genesis Rock</span><span class="answer">anorthosite</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects.

Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage, and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by Apollo Telescope Missions, which would replace the LM's descent stage equipment and engine with a solar telescope observatory.

Stan Lebar, who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at Westinghouse Electric Corporation, also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f239271a42140099d35d"><p> <strong class="question">What type of camera was used to record the Moon landing?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">special Apollo TV camera</span><span class="answer">Apollo TV camera</span><span class="answer">Apollo TV</span><span class="answer">Apollo TV camera</span><span class="answer">Apollo TV camera</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f239271a42140099d35e"><p> <strong class="question">Was this footage compatible or incompatible with live broadcast TV formats?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">incompatible</span><span class="answer">had to be converted</span><span class="answer">incompatible</span><span class="answer">format incompatible with broadcast TV</span><span class="answer">incompatible</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f239271a42140099d35f"><p> <strong class="question">What happened to prompt NASA to record over archived magnetic tapes?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">magnetic tape shortage</span><span class="answer">remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the National Archives and Records Administration to be recorded over</span><span class="answer">magnetic tape shortage</span><span class="answer">magnetic tape shortage</span><span class="answer">magnetic tape shortage</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f239271a42140099d360"><p> <strong class="question">What did NASA record over the older archived tapes?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">newer satellite data</span><span class="answer">the National Archives and Records Administration</span><span class="answer">newer satellite data</span><span class="answer">satellite data</span><span class="answer">satellite data</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f239271a42140099d361"><p> <strong class="question">Who worked later on to find these missing magnetic tapes that had data stored on them?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Stan Lebar</span><span class="answer">Nafzger</span><span class="answer">Stan Lebar</span><span class="answer">Stan Lebar</span><span class="answer">Stan Lebar</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>With a budget of $230,000, the surviving original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 was compiled by Nafzger and assigned to Lowry Digital for restoration. The video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy. The images were from tapes in Australia, the CBS News archive, and kinescope recordings made at Johnson Space Center. The restored video, remaining in black and white, contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f39638643c19005acef7"><p> <strong class="question">Who compiled the original surviving Apollo 11 landing data?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Nafzger</span><span class="answer">Nafzger</span><span class="answer">Nafzger</span><span class="answer">Nafzger</span><span class="answer">Nafzger</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f39638643c19005acef8"><p> <strong class="question">Were the tapes able to be restored and processed without destroying historical legitimacy or did some aspects of the tapes lose legitimacy?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">without destroying historical legitimacy</span><span class="answer">Lowry Digital f</span><span class="answer">without destroying historical legitimacy</span><span class="answer">processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy</span><span class="answer">without destroying historical legitimacy</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f39638643c19005acef9"><p> <strong class="question">What types of recordings at Johnson Space Center were used to help restore the original tapes?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">kinescope recordings</span><span class="answer">kinescope</span><span class="answer">kinescope recordings</span><span class="answer">kinescope</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f39638643c19005acefa"><p> <strong class="question">Which company was tasked with trying to restore the original tapes?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Lowry Digital</span><span class="answer">CBS</span><span class="answer">Lowry Digital</span><span class="answer">Lowry Digital</span><span class="answer">Lowry Digital</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f39638643c19005acefb"><p> <strong class="question">Were the restored tapes able to have color added to them to enhance the picture or did they remain black and white?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">black and white</span><span class="answer">black and white,</span><span class="answer">black and white</span><span class="answer">remaining in black and white</span><span class="answer">remaining in black and white,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD</a></li><li><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/evaluate.js"></script><script src="/SQuAD-explorer/javascripts/model.js"></script></body></html>
