Although the Mongols had ruled territories including today's North China for decades, it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style. His realm was, by this point, isolated from the other khanates and controlled most of present-day China and its surrounding areas, including modern Mongolia and Korea. It was the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368, after which its Genghisid rulers returned to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule the Northern Yuan dynasty. Some of the Mongolian Emperors of the Yuan mastered the Chinese language, while others only used their native language (i.e. Mongolian) and the 'Phags-pa script.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57285ed5ff5b5019007da1b6"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Chinese name for the Yuan dynasty?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Yuán Cháo</span><span class="answer">Yuán Cháo</span><span class="answer">元朝</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57285ed5ff5b5019007da1b7"><p> <strong class="question">What is the Yuan dynasty's official name?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Great Yuan</span><span class="answer">the Great Yuan</span><span class="answer">the Great Yuan</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57285ed5ff5b5019007da1b8"><p> <strong class="question">Who started the Yuan dynasty?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Kublai Khan</span><span class="answer">Kublai Khan</span><span class="answer">Kublai Khan</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57285ed5ff5b5019007da1b9"><p> <strong class="question">Who led the Mongolian Borjigin clan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Kublai Khan</span><span class="answer">Kublai Khan</span><span class="answer">Kublai Khan</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57285ed5ff5b5019007da1ba"><p> <strong class="question">When did Khan formally declare the Yuan dynasty?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1271</span><span class="answer">1271</span><span class="answer">1271</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Yuan dynasty is considered both a successor to the Mongol Empire and an imperial Chinese dynasty. It was the khanate ruled by the successors of Möngke Khan after the division of the Mongol Empire. In official Chinese histories, the Yuan dynasty bore the Mandate of Heaven, following the Song dynasty and preceding the Ming dynasty. The dynasty was established by Kublai Khan, yet he placed his grandfather Genghis Khan on the imperial records as the official founder of the dynasty as Taizu.[b] In the Proclamation of the Dynastic Name (《建國號詔》), Kublai announced the name of the new dynasty as Great Yuan and claimed the succession of former Chinese dynasties from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Tang dynasty.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572860e03acd2414000df977"><p> <strong class="question">What non-Chinese empire did the Yuan dynasty succeed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Mongol Empire</span><span class="answer">Mongol Empire</span><span class="answer">Mongol Empire</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572860e03acd2414000df978"><p> <strong class="question">What dynasty came before the Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Song dynasty</span><span class="answer">Mongol Empire</span><span class="answer">the Song dynasty</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572860e03acd2414000df979"><p> <strong class="question">What dynasty came after the Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Ming dynasty</span><span class="answer">Ming dynasty</span><span class="answer">the Ming dynasty</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572860e03acd2414000df97a"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Kublai Khan's grandfather?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Genghis Khan</span><span class="answer">Genghis Khan</span><span class="answer">Genghis Khan</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In 1271, Kublai Khan imposed the name Great Yuan (Chinese: 大元; pinyin: Dà Yuán; Wade–Giles: Ta-Yüan), establishing the Yuan dynasty. &quot;Dà Yuán&quot; (大元) is from the sentence &quot;大哉乾元&quot; (dà zai Qián Yuán / &quot;Great is Qián, the Primal&quot;) in the Commentaries on the Classic of Changes (I Ching) section regarding Qián (乾). The counterpart in Mongolian language was Dai Ön Ulus, also rendered as Ikh Yuan Üls or Yekhe Yuan Ulus. In Mongolian, Dai Ön (Great Yuan) is often used in conjunction with the &quot;Yeke Mongghul Ulus&quot; (lit. &quot;Great Mongol State&quot;), resulting in Dai Ön Yeke Mongghul Ulus (Mongolian script: ), meaning &quot;Great Yuan Great Mongol State&quot;. The Yuan dynasty is also known as the &quot;Mongol dynasty&quot; or &quot;Mongol Dynasty of China&quot;, similar to the names &quot;Manchu dynasty&quot; or &quot;Manchu Dynasty of China&quot; for the Qing dynasty. Furthermore, the Yuan is sometimes known as the &quot;Empire of the Great Khan&quot; or &quot;Khanate of the Great Khan&quot;, which particularly appeared on some Yuan maps, since Yuan emperors held the nominal title of Great Khan. Nevertheless, both terms can also refer to the khanate within the Mongol Empire directly ruled by Great Khans before the actual establishment of the Yuan dynasty by Kublai Khan in 1271.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286192ff5b5019007da1dc"><p> <strong class="question">When did Khan establish the Great Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1271</span><span class="answer">1271</span><span class="answer">1271</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286192ff5b5019007da1dd"><p> <strong class="question">What writing inspired the name Great Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Commentaries on the Classic of Changes (I Ching)</span><span class="answer">the Commentaries on the Classic of Changes</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286192ff5b5019007da1de"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Yuan dynasty called in Mongolian?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Dai Ön Ulus, also rendered as Ikh Yuan Üls or Yekhe Yuan Ulus</span><span class="answer">Dai Ön Ulus</span><span class="answer">Dai Ön Ulus</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286192ff5b5019007da1df"><p> <strong class="question">What does Yeke Mongghul Ulus mean?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Great Mongol State</span><span class="answer">Great Mongol State</span><span class="answer">Great Mongol State</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286192ff5b5019007da1e0"><p> <strong class="question">What nominal title did Yuan emperors have?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Great Khan</span><span class="answer">Great Khan</span><span class="answer">Great Khan</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Genghis Khan united the Mongol and Turkic tribes of the steppes and became Great Khan in 1206.

Under the reign of Genghis' third son, Ögedei Khan, the Mongols destroyed the weakened Jin dynasty in 1234, conquering most of northern China. Ögedei offered his nephew Kublai a position in Xingzhou, Hebei. Kublai was unable to read Chinese but had several Han Chinese teachers attached to him since his early years by his mother Sorghaghtani. He sought the counsel of Chinese Buddhist and Confucian advisers. Möngke Khan succeeded Ögedei's son, Güyük, as Great Khan in 1251. He granted his brother Kublai control over Mongol held territories in China. Kublai built schools for Confucian scholars, issued paper money, revived Chinese rituals, and endorsed policies that stimulated agricultural and commercial growth. He adopted as his capital city Kaiping in Inner Mongolia, later renamed Shangdu.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572863c72ca10214002da2d4"><p> <strong class="question">Which tribes did Genghis Khan unite?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Mongol and Turkic tribes</span><span class="answer">Mongol and Turkic tribes</span><span class="answer">the Mongol and Turkic tribes</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572863c72ca10214002da2d5"><p> <strong class="question">When did Genghis Khan become Great Khan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1206</span><span class="answer">1206</span><span class="answer">1206</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572863c72ca10214002da2d6"><p> <strong class="question">Who was Genghis's 3rd son?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Ögedei Khan</span><span class="answer">Ögedei Khan</span><span class="answer">Ögedei Khan</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572863c72ca10214002da2d7"><p> <strong class="question">When did Mongke Khan become Great Khan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1251</span><span class="answer">1251</span><span class="answer">1251</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572863c72ca10214002da2d8"><p> <strong class="question">What was Kublai Khan's relation to Ogedei Khan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">nephew</span><span class="answer">nephew</span><span class="answer">nephew</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Many Han Chinese and Khitan defected to the Mongols to fight against the Jin.

Kublai returned from fighting the Song in 1260 when he learned that his brother, Ariq Böke, was challenging his claim to the throne. Kublai convened a kurultai in Kaiping that elected him Great Khan. A rival kurultai in Mongolia proclaimed Ariq Böke Great Khan, beginning a civil war. Kublai depended on the cooperation of his Chinese subjects to ensure that his army received ample resources. He bolstered his popularity among his subjects by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional Chinese dynasties and adopting the Chinese era name of Zhongtong. Ariq Böke was hampered by inadequate supplies and surrendered in 1264. All of the three western khanates (Golden Horde, Chagatai Khanate and Ilkhanate) became functionally autonomous, although only the Ilkhans truly recognized Kublai as Great Khan. Civil strife had permanently divided the Mongol Empire.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572867212ca10214002da2f2"><p> <strong class="question">Who led a Mongol attack on the Song dynasty?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Möngke Khan</span><span class="answer">Möngke Khan</span><span class="answer">Möngke Khan</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572867212ca10214002da2f3"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Mongke Khan attack the Song dynasty?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">southern China</span><span class="answer">southern China</span><span class="answer">in southern China</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572867212ca10214002da2f4"><p> <strong class="question">When did Mongke Khan die?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1259</span><span class="answer">1259</span><span class="answer">in 1259</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572867212ca10214002da2f5"><p> <strong class="question">Who challenged Kublai Khan's right to succeed Mongke Khan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Ariq Böke</span><span class="answer">Ariq Böke</span><span class="answer">Ariq Böke</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572867212ca10214002da2f6"><p> <strong class="question">What Chinese era name did Kublai adopt?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Zhongtong</span><span class="answer">Zhongtong.

Kublai secured the northeast border in 1259 by installing the hostage prince Wonjong as the ruler of Korea, making it a Mongol tributary state. Kublai was also threatened by domestic unrest. Li Tan, the son-in-law of a powerful official, instigated a revolt against Mongol rule in 1262. After successfully suppressing the revolt, Kublai curbed the influence of the Han Chinese advisers in his court.

He restored the Imperial Secretariat and left the local administrative structure of past Chinese dynasties unchanged. However, Kublai rejected plans to revive the Confucian imperial examinations and divided Yuan society into three, later four, classes with the Han Chinese occupying the lowest rank. Kublai's Chinese advisers still wielded significant power in the government, but their official rank was nebulous.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572869b84b864d19001649ae"><p> <strong class="question">What did Kublai's government have to balance between?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">preserving Mongol interests in China and satisfying the demands of his Chinese subjects</span><span class="answer">preserving Mongol interests in China and satisfying the demands of his Chinese subjects</span><span class="answer">preserving Mongol interests in China and satisfying the demands of his Chinese subjects</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572869b84b864d19001649b0"><p> <strong class="question">What administrative division did Kublai leave unmodified?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">local administrative structure of past Chinese dynasties</span><span class="answer">local administrative structure</span><span class="answer">local</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572869b84b864d19001649b2"><p> <strong class="question">Who would have been the lowest-ranked class?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Han Chinese</span><span class="answer">Han Chinese</span><span class="answer">the Han Chinese</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572869b84b864d19001649b1"><p> <strong class="question">How many societal class divisions were in the plan Kublai rejected?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">three, later four</span><span class="answer">four</span><span class="answer">three</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572869b84b864d19001649af"><p> <strong class="question">What natural resources did the Chinese government have a monopoly on?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">salt and iron</span><span class="answer">salt and iron</span><span class="answer">salt and iron</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Kublai readied the move of the Mongol capital from Karakorum in Mongolia to Khanbaliq in 1264, constructing a new city near the former Jurchen capital Zhongdu, now modern Beijing, in 1266.

The name of the dynasty originated from the I Ching and describes the &quot;origin of the universe&quot; or a &quot;primal force&quot;. Kublai proclaimed Khanbaliq the &quot;Great Capital&quot; or Daidu (Dadu, Chinese: 大都 in Chinese) of the dynasty. The era name was changed to Zhiyuan to herald a new era of Chinese history.

Wars and construction projects had drained the Mongol treasury. Efforts to raise and collect tax revenues were plagued by corruption and political scandals. Mishandled military expeditions followed the financial problems. Kublai's second invasion of Japan in 1281 failed because of an inauspicious typhoon. Kublai botched his campaigns against Annam, Champa, and Java, but won a Pyrrhic victory against Burma. The expeditions were hampered by disease, an inhospitable climate, and a tropical terrain unsuitable for the mounted warfare of the Mongols. The Tran dynasty which ruled Annam (Dai Viet) crushed and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Bạch Đằng (1288). The Chinese region of Fujian was the original home of the Chinese Tran (Chen) clan before they migrated under Trần Kinh (陳京, Chén Jīng) to Dai Viet and whose descendants established the Trần dynasty which ruled Vietnam Đại Việt, and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Trần prince Trần Quốc Tuấn (later King Trần Hưng Đạo) in 1282. Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song and they helped the Tran fight against the Mongol invasion. The Tran dynasty originated from the Fujian region of China as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as &quot;Northern bandits&quot;. Annam, Burma, and Champa recognized Mongol hegemony and established tributary relations with the Yuan dynasty.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286dfa2ca10214002da332"><p> <strong class="question">When was Kublai's administration running out of money?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">after 1279</span><span class="answer">after 1279</span><span class="answer">after 1279</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286dfa2ca10214002da333"><p> <strong class="question">What interfered with Kublai's second invasion of Japan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">an inauspicious typhoon</span><span class="answer">inauspicious typhoon</span><span class="answer">inauspicious typhoon</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286dfa2ca10214002da334"><p> <strong class="question">Where did the Tran dynasty rule?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Annam (Dai Viet)</span><span class="answer">Annam</span><span class="answer">Annam</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286dfa2ca10214002da335"><p> <strong class="question">In what battle were the Mongols defeated by the Tran?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Battle of Bạch Đằng</span><span class="answer">Battle of Bạch Đằng</span><span class="answer">the Battle of Bạch Đằng</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286dfa2ca10214002da336"><p> <strong class="question">When were the Mongols defeated by the Tran?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1288</span><span class="answer">1288</span><span class="answer">1288</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Following the conquest of Dali in 1253, the former ruling Duan dynasty were appointed as governors-general, recognized as imperial officials by the Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era governments, principally in the province of Yunnan.

Kublai originally named his eldest son, Zhenjin, as the Crown Prince, but he died before Kublai in 1285. Thus, Zhenjin's third son, with the support of his mother Kökejin and the minister Bayan, succeeded the throne and ruled as Temür Khan, or Emperor Chengzong, from 1294 to 1307. Temür Khan decided to maintain and continue much of the work begun by his grandfather. He also made peace with the western Mongol khanates as well as neighboring countries such as Vietnam, which recognized his nominal suzerainty and paid tributes for a few decades.

Also, he codified much of the law, as well as publishing or translating a number of Chinese books and works.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286f373acd2414000df9db"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the 4th to rule the Yuan dynasty?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Buyantu Khan</span><span class="answer">Buyantu Khan</span><span class="answer">Buyantu Khan</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286f373acd2414000df9dc"><p> <strong class="question">What did the Mongol elites wish Buyantu didn't do?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">actively support and adopt mainstream Chinese culture</span><span class="answer">actively support and adopt mainstream Chinese culture</span><span class="answer">adopt mainstream Chinese culture</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286f373acd2414000df9dd"><p> <strong class="question">Who mentored Buyantu?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Li Meng</span><span class="answer">Li Meng</span><span class="answer">Li Meng</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286f373acd2414000df9de"><p> <strong class="question">What government department did Buyantu shut down?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Department of State Affairs</span><span class="answer">Department of State Affairs</span><span class="answer">the Department of State Affairs</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57286f373acd2414000df9df"><p> <strong class="question">When did Buyantu resume testing potential government employees?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1313</span><span class="answer">1313</span><span class="answer">1313</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Emperor Gegeen Khan, Ayurbarwada's son and successor, ruled for only two years, from 1321 to 1323.

He was installed as the emperor (Emperor Wenzong) in Khanbaliq, while Yesün Temür's son Ragibagh succeeded to the throne in Shangdu with the support of Yesün Temür's favorite retainer Dawlat Shah. Gaining support from princes and officers in Northern China and some other parts of the dynasty, Khanbaliq-based Tugh Temür eventually won the civil war against Ragibagh known as the War of the Two Capitals. Afterwards, Tugh Temür abdicated in favour of his brother Kusala, who was backed by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey, and announced Khanbaliq's intent to welcome him. However, Kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with Tugh Temür. He was supposedly killed with poison by El Temür, and Tugh Temür then remounted the throne. Tugh Temür also managed to send delegates to the western Mongol khanates such as Golden Horde and Ilkhanate to be accepted as the suzerain of Mongol world. However, he was mainly a puppet of the powerful official El Temür during his latter three-year reign. El Temür purged pro-Kusala officials and brought power to warlords, whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the dynasty.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728705c2ca10214002da35a"><p> <strong class="question">Where did Yesun Temur die?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Shangdu</span><span class="answer">Shangdu</span><span class="answer">Shangdu</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728705c2ca10214002da35b"><p> <strong class="question">What was the civil war against Ragibagh also called?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the War of the Two Capitals</span><span class="answer">War of the Two Capitals</span><span class="answer">the War of the Two Capitals</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728705c2ca10214002da35c"><p> <strong class="question">How long after a banquet with Tugh Temur did Kusala die?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">four days</span><span class="answer">four days</span><span class="answer">four days</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728705c2ca10214002da35d"><p> <strong class="question">Who was thought to have killed Tugh Temur?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">El Temür</span><span class="answer">El Temür</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728705c2ca10214002da35e"><p> <strong class="question">Who took the throne after Kusala's death?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Tugh Temür</span><span class="answer">Tugh Temür</span><span class="answer">Tugh Temür</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Due to the fact that the bureaucracy was dominated by El Temür, Tugh Temür is known for his cultural contribution instead.

After El Temür's death, Bayan became as powerful an official as El Temür had been in the beginning of his long reign. As Toghun Temür grew, he came to disapprove of Bayan's autocratic rule. In 1340 he allied himself with Bayan's nephew Toqto'a, who was in discord with Bayan, and banished Bayan by coup. With the dismissal of Bayan, Toghtogha seized the power of the court. His first administration clearly exhibited fresh new spirit. He also gave a few early signs of a new and positive direction in central government. One of his successful projects was to finish the long-stalled official histories of the Liao, Jin, and Song dynasties, which were eventually completed in 1345.

The other cultures and peoples in the Mongol World Empire also very much influenced China. It had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia until its decline; the communications between Yuan dynasty and its ally and subordinate in Persia, the Ilkhanate, encouraged this development. Buddhism had a great influence in the Yuan government, and the Tibetan-rite Tantric Buddhism had significantly influenced China during this period.

Advances were realized in the fields of travel literature, cartography, geography, and scientific education.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572879574b864d1900164a14"><p> <strong class="question">What type of musical instruments did the Yuan bring to China?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Western</span><span class="answer">Western</span><span class="answer">Western</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572879574b864d1900164a15"><p> <strong class="question">Besides Confucianism, Buddhism, and Islam, what religions were tolerated during the Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Nestorianism and Roman Catholicism</span><span class="answer">Nestorianism and Roman Catholicism</span><span class="answer">Nestorianism and Roman Catholicism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572879574b864d1900164a16"><p> <strong class="question">What religion did the Yuan discourage, to support Buddhism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Taoism</span><span class="answer">Taoism</span><span class="answer">Taoism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572879574b864d1900164a17"><p> <strong class="question">What type of practices did the Yuan reintroduce in government?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Confucian</span><span class="answer">Confucian governmental practices and examinations</span><span class="answer">Confucian</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572879574b864d1900164a18"><p> <strong class="question">What fields of study were advanced during the Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">travel literature, cartography, geography, and scientific education</span><span class="answer">travel literature, cartography, geography, and scientific education</span><span class="answer">literature, cartography, geography, and scientific education</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The first recorded travels by Europeans to China and back date from this time.

The account of his travels, Il milione (or, The Million, known in English as the Travels of Marco Polo), appeared about the year 1299. Some argue over the accuracy of Marco Polo's accounts due to the lack of mentioning the Great Wall of China, tea houses, which would have been a prominent sight since Europeans had yet to adopt a tea culture, as well the practice of foot binding by the women in capital of the Great Khan. Some suggest that Marco Polo acquired much of his knowledge through contact with Persian traders since many of the places he named were in Persian.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287b4a4b864d1900164a28"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the first known European to visit China and return?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Marco Polo</span><span class="answer">Marco Polo</span><span class="answer">Marco Polo</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287b4a4b864d1900164a29"><p> <strong class="question">What did Polo call the Yuan capital?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Cambaluc</span><span class="answer">Cambaluc</span><span class="answer">Cambaluc</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287b4a4b864d1900164a2a"><p> <strong class="question">What was the English title of Polo's book?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Travels of Marco Polo</span><span class="answer">Travels of Marco Polo</span><span class="answer">the Travels of Marco Polo</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287b4a4b864d1900164a2b"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Italian title of Polo's book?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Il milione</span><span class="answer">Il milione</span><span class="answer">Il milione</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287b4a4b864d1900164a2c"><p> <strong class="question">How did some suspect that Polo learned about China instead of by actually visiting it?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">through contact with Persian traders</span><span class="answer">through contact with Persian traders</span><span class="answer">through contact with Persian traders</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Yuan undertook extensive public works.

Road and water communications were reorganized and improved. To provide against possible famines, granaries were ordered built throughout the empire. The city of Beijing was rebuilt with new palace grounds that included artificial lakes, hills and mountains, and parks. During the Yuan period, Beijing became the terminus of the Grand Canal of China, which was completely renovated. These commercially oriented improvements encouraged overland and maritime commerce throughout Asia and facilitated direct Chinese contacts with Europe. Chinese travelers to the West were able to provide assistance in such areas as hydraulic engineering. Contacts with the West also brought the introduction to China of a major food crop, sorghum, along with other foreign food products and methods of preparation.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287c142ca10214002da3d0"><p> <strong class="question">What astronomer worked for Kublai?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Guo Shoujing</span><span class="answer">Guo Shoujing</span><span class="answer">Guo Shoujing</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287c142ca10214002da3d1"><p> <strong class="question">How accurate did Guo make the reformed lunisolar calendar?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">26 seconds off the modern Gregorian calendar</span><span class="answer">365.2425 days of the year</span><span class="answer">365.2425 days of the year</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287c142ca10214002da3d2"><p> <strong class="question">What did Kublai do to prevent famines?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">granaries were ordered built throughout the empire</span><span class="answer">granaries were ordered built throughout the empire</span><span class="answer">granaries were ordered built</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287c142ca10214002da3d3"><p> <strong class="question">What city did the Grand Canal reach during the Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Beijing</span><span class="answer">Beijing</span><span class="answer">Beijing</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287c142ca10214002da3d4"><p> <strong class="question">What major crop was brought to China from the west?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">sorghum</span><span class="answer">sorghum</span><span class="answer">sorghum</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Yuan dynasty was the first time that non-native Chinese people ruled all of China.

Note, however, Yuan dynasty is traditionally often extended to cover the Mongol Empire before Kublai Khan's formal establishment of the Yuan in 1271, partly because Kublai had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or Taizu (Chinese: 太祖). Despite the traditional historiography as well as the official views (including the government of the Ming dynasty which overthrew the Yuan dynasty), there also exist Chinese people[who?] who did not consider the Yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of China, but rather as a period of foreign domination. The latter believe that Han Chinese were treated as second-class citizens,[citation needed] and that China stagnated economically and scientifically.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287ccb2ca10214002da3da"><p> <strong class="question">The Yuan was the first time all of China was ruled by whom?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">non-native Chinese people</span><span class="answer">non-native Chinese people</span><span class="answer">non-native Chinese</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287ccb2ca10214002da3db"><p> <strong class="question">What did Mongols worship?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the Eternal Heaven</span><span class="answer">Eternal Heaven</span><span class="answer">the Eternal Heaven</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287ccb2ca10214002da3dc"><p> <strong class="question">What legitimate dynasty came before the Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Song</span><span class="answer">Song dynasty</span><span class="answer">the Song dynasty</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287ccb2ca10214002da3dd"><p> <strong class="question">What legitimate dynasty came after the Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Ming</span><span class="answer">Ming dynasty</span><span class="answer">the Ming dynasty</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287ccb2ca10214002da3de"><p> <strong class="question">Some Chinese considered the Yuan a legitimate dynasty, but what did other Chinese think it was?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a period of foreign domination</span><span class="answer">continuation of the Mongol Empire</span><span class="answer">a period of foreign domination</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The system of bureaucracy created by Kublai Khan reflected various cultures in the empire, including that of the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists. While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287d4a2ca10214002da3e4"><p> <strong class="question">What cultures were part of Kublai's administration?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists</span><span class="answer">Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists.</span><span class="answer">the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287d4a2ca10214002da3e5"><p> <strong class="question">What dynasties inspired the Chinese-like elements of Kublai's government?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties</span><span class="answer">native Chinese dynasties</span><span class="answer">Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287d4a2ca10214002da3e6"><p> <strong class="question">Who were two of Kublai's Chinese advisers?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu</span><span class="answer">Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu</span><span class="answer">Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287d4a2ca10214002da3e7"><p> <strong class="question">What kind of division of power did Kublai's government have?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">tripartite</span><span class="answer">tripartite division</span><span class="answer">tripartite</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287d4a2ca10214002da3e8"><p> <strong class="question">What were the three parts of Kublai's government?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">civil, military, and censorial offices</span><span class="answer">civil, military, and censorial</span><span class="answer">civil, military, and censorial offices</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While the existence of these central government departments and the Six Ministries (which had been introduced since the Sui and Tang dynasties) gave a Sinicized image in the Yuan administration, the actual functions of these ministries also reflected how Mongolian priorities and policies reshaped and redirected those institutions.

Seeing this as damaging to the Mongol nation, Kublai in 1291 forbade the sale abroad of Mongols.

Due to the coming together of painting, poetry, and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others. Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy, the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together. In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters. In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era. In Yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets. Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time, and the other way around, with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu. One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form. One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry, painting, and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art. Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current, vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show. Another important consideration regarding Yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in China, relatively to works from the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty, which have often been better preserved in places such as the Shōsōin, in Japan.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287f6a3acd2414000dfa51"><p> <strong class="question">What type of arts flourished in the Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">painting, mathematics, calligraphy, poetry, and theater</span><span class="answer">painting, mathematics, calligraphy, poetry, and theater</span><span class="answer">painting, mathematics, calligraphy, poetry, and theater</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287f6a3acd2414000dfa52"><p> <strong class="question">Which arts were often practiced together by the same artists?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">painting, poetry, and calligraphy</span><span class="answer">painting, poetry, and calligraphy</span><span class="answer">painting, poetry, and calligraphy</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287f6a3acd2414000dfa53"><p> <strong class="question">What dynasty shared artistic inspiration with the Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Song</span><span class="answer">Song</span><span class="answer">the Song dynasty</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287f6a3acd2414000dfa54"><p> <strong class="question">What form of poetry was developed in the Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the qu</span><span class="answer">the qu</span><span class="answer">qu</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287f6a3acd2414000dfa55"><p> <strong class="question">What was a popular type of variety show during the Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">zaju</span><span class="answer">zaju</span><span class="answer">zaju</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>There were many religions practiced during the Yuan dynasty, such as Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. The establishment of the Yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of Muslims in China. However, unlike the western khanates, the Yuan dynasty never converted to Islam. Instead, Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty, favored Buddhism, especially the Tibetan variants. As a result, Tibetan Buddhism was established as the de facto state religion. The top-level department and government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. He and his successors kept a Sakya Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) at court. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of Imperial Preceptor, thereby enjoying special power. Furthermore, Mongol patronage of Buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist art. Mongolian Buddhist translations, almost all from Tibetan originals, began on a large scale after 1300. Many Mongols of the upper class such as the Jalayir and the Oronar nobles as well as the emperors also patronized Confucian scholars and institutions. A considerable number of Confucian and Chinese historical works were translated into the Mongolian language.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287fec4b864d1900164a3c"><p> <strong class="question">Which khanates had converted to Islam?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">western</span><span class="answer">Yuan dynasty</span><span class="answer">western</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287fec4b864d1900164a3d"><p> <strong class="question">Which religion did Kublai prefer?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Buddhism, especially the Tibetan variants</span><span class="answer">Buddhism</span><span class="answer">Buddhism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287fec4b864d1900164a3e"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Yuan's unofficial state religion?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Tibetan Buddhism</span><span class="answer">Tibetan Buddhism</span><span class="answer">Tibetan Buddhism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287fec4b864d1900164a3f"><p> <strong class="question">What government agency supervised Buddhist monks?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs</span><span class="answer">Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs</span><span class="answer">the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57287fec4b864d1900164a40"><p> <strong class="question">What was Kublai's favorite sect of Tibetan Buddhism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Sakya</span><span class="answer">Sakya sect</span><span class="answer">Sakya sect</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Advances in polynomial algebra were made by mathematicians during the Yuan era.

The calendar may have been influenced solely by the work of Song dynasty astronomer Shen Kuo or possibly by the work of Arab astronomers. There are no explicit signs of Muslim influences in the Shoushi calendar, but Mongol rulers were known to be interested in Muslim calendars.

The Il-khanate government issued paper money in 1294, but public distrust of the exotic new currency doomed the experiment.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728827b2ca10214002da42a"><p> <strong class="question">What was the Yuan's paper money called?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">chao</span><span class="answer">chao</span><span class="answer">the chao</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728827b2ca10214002da42b"><p> <strong class="question">What were chao made out of?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">bark of mulberry trees</span><span class="answer">bark of mulberry trees</span><span class="answer">bark of mulberry trees</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728827b2ca10214002da42c"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Yuan begin using bronze printing plates for its money?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1275</span><span class="answer">1275</span><span class="answer">1275</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728827b2ca10214002da42d"><p> <strong class="question">What had the Yuan used to print its money before bronze plates?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">woodblocks</span><span class="answer">woodblocks</span><span class="answer">woodblocks</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5728827b2ca10214002da42e"><p> <strong class="question">When did the Il-khanate experiment with paper money?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1294</span><span class="answer">1294</span><span class="answer">1294</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Politically, the system of government created by Kublai Khan was the product of a compromise between Mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional Chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, socially the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties. Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong &quot;colonial&quot; coloration. The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule. The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century. In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate. Later the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the Yuan dynasty. In response to an objection against the use of &quot;barbarians&quot; in his government, the Yongle Emperor answered: &quot;... Discrimination was used by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty, who employed only &quot;Mongols and Tartars&quot; and discarded northern and southern Chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572883153acd2414000dfa6f"><p> <strong class="question">What Mongolian system did Kublai's government compromise with?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">patrimonial feudalism</span><span class="answer">patrimonial feudalism</span><span class="answer">patrimonial feudalism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572883153acd2414000dfa70"><p> <strong class="question">What Chinese system did Kublai's government compromise with?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">traditional Chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system</span><span class="answer">autocratic-bureaucratic</span><span class="answer">autocratic-bureaucratic system</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572883153acd2414000dfa71"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the Semuren?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire</span><span class="answer">various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire</span><span class="answer">various allied groups</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572883153acd2414000dfa72"><p> <strong class="question">How did the unequal treatment of Chinese versus Mongols in the Yuan make the dynasty seem?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">colonial</span><span class="answer">somewhat strong &quot;colonial&quot; coloration</span><span class="answer">colonial</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="572883153acd2414000dfa73"><p> <strong class="question">Where were Persians more successful compared to Chinese in the Yuan?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Ilkhanate</span><span class="answer">Ilkhanate</span><span class="answer">reaching the highest-post in the government</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands. Han Chinese were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers. Alans were recruited into the Mongol forces with one unit called &quot;Right Alan Guard&quot; which was combined with &quot;recently surrendered&quot; soldiers, Mongols, and Chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former Kingdom of Qocho and in Besh Balikh the Mongols established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi (Ch'i Kung-chih). After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia by Genghis Khan, foreigners were chosen as administrators and co-management with Chinese and Qara-Khitays (Khitans) of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them.

Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant &quot;barracks&quot; and could also mean &quot;thanks&quot;. Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them. During the war fighting the Mongols, among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng. The Muslims in the semu class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57288428ff5b5019007da28e"><p> <strong class="question">What Yuan policies did Muslims dislike?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like circumcision</span><span class="answer">circumcision</span><span class="answer">restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like circumcision</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57288428ff5b5019007da28f"><p> <strong class="question">What Jewish practice did the Yuan ban?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Kosher butchering</span><span class="answer">Kosher butchering</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57288428ff5b5019007da290"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded the Ming dynasty?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Zhu Yuanzhang</span><span class="answer">Zhu Yuanzhang</span><span class="answer">thanks</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57288428ff5b5019007da291"><p> <strong class="question">What was the second meaning of a Chinese word for 'barracks'?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">thanks</span><span class="answer">thanks</span><span class="answer">thanks</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57288428ff5b5019007da292"><p> <strong class="question">Who revolted in the Ispah Rebellion?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Muslims in the semu class</span><span class="answer">Muslims in the semu class</span><span class="answer">Muslims in the semu class</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The historian Frederick W.
