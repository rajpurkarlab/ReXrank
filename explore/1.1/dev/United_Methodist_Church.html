In the 19th century its main predecessor was a leader in Evangelicalism. Founded in 1968 by the union of the Methodist Church (USA) and the Evangelical United Brethren Church, the UMC traces its roots back to the revival movement of John and Charles Wesley in England as well as the Great Awakening in the United States. As such, the church's theological orientation is decidedly Wesleyan.

As a result of the American Revolution, John Wesley was compelled in 1784 to break with standard practice and ordain two of his lay preachers as presbyters, Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat. Dr. Thomas Coke, already an Anglican priest, assisted Wesley in this action. Coke was then &quot;set apart&quot; as a superintendent (bishop) by Wesley and dispatched with Vasey and Whatcoat to America to take charge of Methodist activities there. In defense of his action to ordain, Wesley himself cited an ancient opinion from the Church of Alexandria, which held that bishops and presbyters constituted one order and therefore, bishops are to be elected from and by the presbyterate. He knew that for two centuries the succession of bishops in the Church of Alexandria was preserved through ordination by presbyters alone and was considered valid by the ancient church. Methodists today who would argue for apostolic succession would do so on these grounds.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730aaa88ab72b1400f9c64e"><p> <strong class="question">Why was Wesley compelled to break with standard practice and ordain two of his lay preachers as presbyters?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">result of the American Revolution</span><span class="answer">As a result of the American Revolution,</span><span class="answer">the American Revolution</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730aaa88ab72b1400f9c650"><p> <strong class="question">Who assisted Wesley with ordaining Whatcoat and Vasey as presbyters?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Dr. Thomas Coke</span><span class="answer">Dr. Thomas Coke</span><span class="answer">Dr. Thomas Coke</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730aaa88ab72b1400f9c64f"><p> <strong class="question">Who were the two lay preachers that Wesley ordained as presbyters?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat.</span><span class="answer">Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat</span><span class="answer">Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>While many United Methodist congregations operate in the evangelical tradition, others reflect the mainline Protestant traditions.

It has been characterized as Arminian theology with an emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit to bring holiness into the life of the participating believer. The United Methodist Church believes in prima scriptura, seeing the Holy Bible as the primary authority in the Church and using sacred tradition, reason, and experience to interpret it, with the aid of the Holy Spirit (see Wesleyan Quadrilateral). Therefore, according to The Book of Discipline, United Methodist theology is at once &quot;catholic, evangelical, and reformed.&quot; Today, the UMC is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations with respect to race, gender, and ideology, though the denomination itself actually includes a very wide spectrum of attitudes. Comparatively, the UMC stands to the right of liberal and progressive Protestant groups such as the United Church of Christ and the Episcopal Church on certain issues (especially regarding sexuality), but to the left of historically conservative evangelical traditions such as the Southern Baptists and Pentecostalism, in regard to theological matters such as social justice and Biblical interpretation. However, it should be noted that the UMC is made up of a broad diversity of thought, and so there are many clergy and laity within the UMC that hold differing viewpoints on such theological matters.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b07c8ab72b1400f9c696"><p> <strong class="question">What has been characterized as Arminian theology with an emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Wesleyan theology</span><span class="answer">Wesleyan theology</span><span class="answer">Wesleyan theology</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b07c8ab72b1400f9c697"><p> <strong class="question">What is seeing the Holy Bible as the primary authority in the Church?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">prima scriptura</span><span class="answer">Wesleyan theology s</span><span class="answer">prima scriptura</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b07c8ab72b1400f9c698"><p> <strong class="question">Today, which church is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">UMC</span><span class="answer">the UMC</span><span class="answer">the UMC</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b07c8ab72b1400f9c699"><p> <strong class="question">What states that United Methodist theology is at once &quot;catholic, evangelical and reformed?&quot;</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Book of Discipline</span><span class="answer">Book of Discipline</span><span class="answer">The Book of Discipline</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The United Methodist Church upholds the sanctity of human life both of the child and the mother.

Today the United Methodist Church states that it &quot;affirms our long-standing support of abstinence from alcohol as a faithful witness to God's liberating and redeeming love for persons.&quot; In fact, the United Methodist Church uses unfermented grape juice in the sacrament of Holy Communion, thus &quot;expressing pastoral concern for recovering alcoholics, enabling the participation of children and youth, and supporting the church's witness of abstinence.&quot; Moreover, in 2011 and 2012, The United Methodist Church's General Board of Church and Society called on all United Methodists to abstain from alcohol for Lent.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b2ac2461fd1900a9cfb3"><p> <strong class="question">Historically, which movement has the Methodist Church supported?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">temperance movement</span><span class="answer">temperance movement.</span><span class="answer">the temperance movement</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b2ac2461fd1900a9cfb6"><p> <strong class="question">When did the UMC's General Board of Church and Society call on all United Methodists to abstain from alcohol for Lent?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2011 and 2012</span><span class="answer">in 2011 and 2012</span><span class="answer">2011 and 2012</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b2ac2461fd1900a9cfb4"><p> <strong class="question">What was the name of Wesley's famous sermon in which he warned against the dangers of drinking?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">The Use of Money</span><span class="answer">The Use of Money,</span><span class="answer">&quot;The Use of Money,&quot;</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b2ac2461fd1900a9cfb5"><p> <strong class="question">What does the United Methodist Church use in the sacrament of the Holy Communion?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">unfermented grape juice</span><span class="answer">uses unfermented grape juice</span><span class="answer">unfermented grape juice</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The United Methodist Church, along with other Methodist churches, condemns capital punishment, saying that it cannot accept retribution or social vengeance as a reason for taking human life.

Other ministers have been defrocked for officiating at same-sex weddings and several trials of others are scheduled. Still, some congregations have sought other ways to recognize same-sex couples. For example, one congregation hosted a proposal for a same-sex couple announcing their engagement. Moreover, some churches, especially in 2016 after same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide, have provided blessings for same-sex marriages. In April of 2016, a United Methodist bishop made a bold statement by performing a same-sex marriage in church as a clear sign of his advocacy for change.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b5cc396df919000962d2"><p> <strong class="question">The UMC prohibits the celebration of what type of unions?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">same-sex unions</span><span class="answer">prohibits the celebration of same-sex unions.</span><span class="answer">same-sex</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b5cc396df919000962d3"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the trial of Rev.

The Judicial Council also affirmed that a Virginia pastor had the right to deny local church membership to a man in an openly gay relationship. This affirmation, however, was based upon a senior pastor's right to judge the readiness of a congregant to join as a full member of the church. However, at the same time, the UMC Judicial Council, in 2008, ruled that conferences can determine their own policy related to transgender pastors, and therefore some regional conferences have voted to recognize ordained transgender pastors.

Appointment tenures in extension ministries, such as military chaplaincy, campus ministry, missions, higher education and other ministries beyond the local church are often even longer.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730d3adaca1c71400fe5af5"><p> <strong class="question">What is composed of the Area Provost/Dean ad the several District Superintendents of the Districts in the Annual Conference?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Annual Conference Cabinet</span><span class="answer">All clergy appointments a</span><span class="answer">the Annual Conference Cabinet</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730d3adaca1c71400fe5af6"><p> <strong class="question">All clergy appointments are made for how long?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">one year at a time</span><span class="answer">one year at a time,</span><span class="answer">one year</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730d3adaca1c71400fe5af7"><p> <strong class="question">No appointment is official fixed until what occurs?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">bishop has read the appointments at the session of the Annual Conference</span><span class="answer">Until the bishop has read the appointments at the session of the Annual Conference,</span><span class="answer">the bishop has read the appointments at the session of the Annual Conference</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Elders are called by God, affirmed by the church, and ordained by a bishop to a ministry of Word, Sacrament, Order and Service within the church.

Local pastors are not required to have advanced degrees but are required to attend licensing school and attend and pass an approved five-year course of study at an approved United Methodist seminary or course of study school, successfully complete written and oral examinations, and appear before the District Committee on Ministry and the Conference Board of Ordained Ministry.

Significantly, about 20% of the conference delegates were from Africa, with Filipinos and Europeans making up another 10%. During the conference, the delegates voted to finalize the induction of the Methodist Church of the Ivory Coast and its 700,000 members into the denomination. Given current trends in the UMC—with overseas churches growing, especially in Africa, and U.S. churches collectively losing about 1,000 members a week—it has been estimated that Africans will make up at least 30% of the delegates at the 2012 General Conference, and it is also possible that 40% of the delegates will be from outside the U.S. One Congolese bishop has estimated that typical Sunday attendance of the UMC is higher in his country than in the entire United States.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730ebe0a5e9cc1400cdbae5"><p> <strong class="question">By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, what was the total UMC membership?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">11.4 million</span><span class="answer">11.4 million</span><span class="answer">11.4 million</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730ebe0a5e9cc1400cdbae6"><p> <strong class="question">By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, what was the total UMC membership in the U.S.?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">7.9 million</span><span class="answer">7.9 million in the U.S</span><span class="answer">7.9 million</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730ebe0a5e9cc1400cdbae7"><p> <strong class="question">By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, what was the total UMC membership overseas?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">3.5 million</span><span class="answer">3.5 million</span><span class="answer">3.5 million</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The UMC is also a member of the Wesleyan Holiness Consortium, which seeks to reconceive and promote Biblical holiness in today's Church.
