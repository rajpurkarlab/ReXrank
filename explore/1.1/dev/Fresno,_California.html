Many Millerton residents, drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding, moved to the new community. Fresno became an incorporated city in 1885. By 1931 the Fresno Traction Company operated 47 streetcars over 49 miles of track.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725cfd0271a42140099d225"><p> <strong class="question">The Central Pacific Railroad established a station for its new line in what year?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1872</span><span class="answer">1872</span><span class="answer">1872</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725cfd0271a42140099d226"><p> <strong class="question">What were the reasons why residents moved to the town of Fresno Station?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding</span><span class="answer">drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding</span><span class="answer">the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725cfd0271a42140099d227"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did Fresno become an incorporated city?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1885</span><span class="answer">1885</span><span class="answer">1885</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725cfd0271a42140099d228"><p> <strong class="question">How many streetcars did the Fresno Traction Company operate in 1931?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">47 streetcars</span><span class="answer">47</span><span class="answer">47</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725cfd0271a42140099d229"><p> <strong class="question">What entity sparked the growth of Fresno Station?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">store</span><span class="answer">store</span><span class="answer">store</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Before World War II, Fresno had many ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Armenia, German Town, Little Italy, and Chinatown.

Largely developed in the 1950s through the 1970s, it has recently experienced a surge in new home construction. It is also the home of the Sunnyside Country Club, which maintains a golf course designed by William P. Bell.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725db98ec44d21400f3d6c5"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the neighborhood of Sunnyside located in Fresno?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Fresno's far southeast side</span><span class="answer">far southeast side</span><span class="answer">far southeast side</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725db98ec44d21400f3d6c6"><p> <strong class="question">What are the two major thoroughfares of Sunnyside?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Kings Canyon Avenue and Clovis Avenue</span><span class="answer">Kings Canyon Avenue and Clovis Avenue</span><span class="answer">Kings Canyon Avenue and Clovis Avenue</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725db98ec44d21400f3d6c7"><p> <strong class="question">When was most of Sunnside developed?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1950s through the 1970s</span><span class="answer">1950s through the 1970s</span><span class="answer">1950s through the 1970s</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725db98ec44d21400f3d6c8"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the home of the Sunnyside Country Club?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Sunnyside</span><span class="answer">Sunnyside</span><span class="answer">Sunnyside</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725db98ec44d21400f3d6c9"><p> <strong class="question">Who designed the golf course located at the Sunnyside Country Club?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">William P.

The theater was built in 1939 and is at Olive and Wishon Avenues in the heart of the Tower District. (The name of the theater refers to a well-known landmark water tower, which is actually in another nearby area). The Tower District neighborhood is just north of downtown Fresno proper, and one-half mile south of Fresno City College. Although the neighborhood was known as a residential area prior, the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II. The character of small local businesses largely remains today. To some extent, the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School, (later renamed California State University at Fresno). In 1916 the college moved to what is now the site of Fresno City College one-half mile north of the Tower District.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725dd7d89a1e219009abfea"><p> <strong class="question">The Tower District is centered around which historic theatre?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Tower Theatre</span><span class="answer">Tower Theatre</span><span class="answer">Tower Theatre</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725dd7d89a1e219009abfeb"><p> <strong class="question">When was the Tower Theatre built?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1939</span><span class="answer">1939</span><span class="answer">1939</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725dd7d89a1e219009abfec"><p> <strong class="question">From what landmark within Fresno does the Tower Theatre get its name?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">water tower</span><span class="answer">water tower</span><span class="answer">water tower</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725dd7d89a1e219009abfed"><p> <strong class="question">What was the original name of California State University at Fresno?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Fresno Normal School</span><span class="answer">Fresno Normal School</span><span class="answer">Fresno Normal School</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725dd7d89a1e219009abfee"><p> <strong class="question">How far is Fresno City College from the Tower District?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">one-half mile</span><span class="answer">one-half mile</span><span class="answer">one-half mile</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>This vibrant and culturally diverse area of retail businesses and residences experienced a renewal after a significant decline in the late 1960s and 1970s.[citation needed] After decades of neglect and suburban flight, the neighborhood revival followed the re-opening of the Tower Theatre in the late 1970s, which at that time showed second and third run movies, along with classic films. Roger Rocka's Dinner Theater &amp; Good Company Players also opened nearby in 1978,[citation needed] at Olive and Wishon Avenues. Fresno native Audra McDonald performed in the leading roles of Evita and The Wiz at the theater while she was a high school student.

The section of Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east is the home to many large, stately homes. The original development of this area began circa 1910, on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field. The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, and was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 developers Billings &amp; Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes. This rapid development was no doubt hastened by the Fresno Traction Company right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725ec8289a1e219009ac0ae"><p> <strong class="question">Which boulevard can you find many majestic homes in the area?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Huntington Boulevard</span><span class="answer">Huntington Boulevard</span><span class="answer">Huntington Boulevard</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725ec8289a1e219009ac0af"><p> <strong class="question">Who mapped the Alta Vista Tract?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">William Stranahan</span><span class="answer">William Stranahan</span><span class="answer">William Stranahan</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725ec8289a1e219009ac0b0"><p> <strong class="question">In what year did developers Billings &amp; Meyering acquire the Alta Vista Tract?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1914</span><span class="answer">1914</span><span class="answer">1914</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725ec8289a1e219009ac0b1"><p> <strong class="question">How many homes did the Alta Vista Tract have five years after Billings &amp; Meyering acquired it?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">267</span><span class="answer">267</span><span class="answer">267</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725ec8289a1e219009ac0b2"><p> <strong class="question">Which company provided streetcar connections between downtown and the hospital?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Fresno Traction Company</span><span class="answer">Fresno Traction Company</span><span class="answer">Fresno Traction Company</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The &quot;West Side&quot; of Fresno, also often called &quot;Southwest Fresno&quot;, is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city.

The neighborhood has very little retail activity, aside from the area near Fresno Street and State Route 99 Freeway (Kearney Palm Shopping Center, built in the late 1990s) and small corner markets scattered throughout.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f190ec44d21400f3d76f"><p> <strong class="question">When were the public housing developments built in the neighborhood?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">between the 1960s and 1990s</span><span class="answer">between the 1960s and 1990s</span><span class="answer">between the 1960s and 1990s</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f190ec44d21400f3d770"><p> <strong class="question">On which corner is the shopping center located?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Fresno and B streets</span><span class="answer">Fresno and B streets</span><span class="answer">Fresno and B streets</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f190ec44d21400f3d771"><p> <strong class="question">What are the two processing facilities in the neighborhood?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Cargill Meat Solutions and Foster Farms</span><span class="answer">Cargill Meat Solutions and Foster Farms</span><span class="answer">Cargill Meat Solutions and Foster Farms</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f190ec44d21400f3d772"><p> <strong class="question">Where is the airport located?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the West Side</span><span class="answer">West Side</span><span class="answer">on the West Side</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f190ec44d21400f3d773"><p> <strong class="question">How much retail activity does the neighborhood have?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">very little</span><span class="answer">very little</span><span class="answer">very little</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>In the north eastern part of Fresno, Woodward Park was founded by the late Ralph Woodward, a long-time Fresno resident. He bequeathed a major portion of his estate in 1968 to provide a regional park and bird sanctuary in Northeast Fresno. The park lies on the South bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road. The initial 235 acres (0.95 km2), combined with additional acres acquired later by the City, brings the park to a sizable 300 acres (1.2 km2). Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley. The Southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing. The park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people, authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover 22 miles (35 km) between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The park's numerous picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life. The park's amphetheatre was renovated in 2010, and has hosted performances by acts such as Deftones, Tech N9ne, and Sevendust as well as numerous others. The park is open April through October, 6am to 10pm and November through March, 6am to 7pm. Woodward Park is home to the annual CIF(California Interscholastic Federation) State Championship cross country meet, which takes place in late November. It is also the home of the Woodward Shakespeare Festival which began performances in the park in 2005.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f2c838643c19005aceed"><p> <strong class="question">Who founded Woodward Park?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Ralph Woodward</span><span class="answer">Ralph Woodward</span><span class="answer">Ralph Woodward</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f2c838643c19005aceee"><p> <strong class="question">How many total acres is Woodward Park?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">300 acres</span><span class="answer">300</span><span class="answer">300</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f2c838643c19005aceef"><p> <strong class="question">How many seats does the amphitheatre at Woodward park have?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">2,500</span><span class="answer">2,500</span><span class="answer">2,500</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f2c838643c19005acef0"><p> <strong class="question">How many miles, once completed, will the the Lewis S.

December and January are the coldest months, and average around 46.5 °F (8.1 °C), and there are 14 nights with freezing lows annually, with the coldest night of the year typically bottoming out below 30 °F (−1.1 °C). July is the warmest month, averaging 83.0 °F (28.3 °C); normally, there are 32 days of 100 °F (37.8 °C)+ highs and 106 days of 90 °F (32.2 °C)+ highs, and in July and August, there are only three or four days where the high does not reach 90 °F (32.2 °C). Summers provide considerable sunshine, with July peaking at 97 percent of the total possible sunlight hours; conversely, January is the lowest with only 46 percent of the daylight time in sunlight because of thick tule fog. However, the year averages 81% of possible sunshine, for a total of 3550 hours. Average annual precipitation is around 11.5 inches (292.1 mm), which, by definition, would classify the area as a semidesert. Most of the wind rose direction occurrences derive from the northwest, as winds are driven downward along the axis of the California Central Valley; in December, January and February there is an increased presence of southeastern wind directions in the wind rose statistics. Fresno meteorology was selected in a national U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study for analysis of equilibrium temperature for use of ten-year meteorological data to represent a warm, dry western United States locale.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f5b1271a42140099d371"><p> <strong class="question">How would one describe the summers in Fresno?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">hot and dry</span><span class="answer">hot and dry</span><span class="answer">hot and dry</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f5b1271a42140099d372"><p> <strong class="question">What month is the warmest in Fresno?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">July</span><span class="answer">July</span><span class="answer">July</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f5b1271a42140099d373"><p> <strong class="question">How much rain per year does Fresno get on average?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">around 11.5 inches</span><span class="answer">11.5 inches (292.1 mm)</span><span class="answer">11.5 inches</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f5b1271a42140099d374"><p> <strong class="question">In which direction does most of the wind in Fresno originate from?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">northwest</span><span class="answer">northwest</span><span class="answer">northwest</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725f5b1271a42140099d375"><p> <strong class="question">In which months does Fresno experience increased wind coming from the southeastern direction?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">December, January and February</span><span class="answer">December, January and February</span><span class="answer">December, January and February</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The official record high temperature for Fresno is 115 °F (46.1 °C), set on July 8, 1905, while the official record low is 17 °F (−8 °C), set on January 6, 1913.

When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, the decision was made to build what is now Interstate 5 on the west side of the Central Valley, and thus bypass many of the population centers in the region, instead of upgrading what is now State Route 99. Due to rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along SR 99, as well as the desirability of Federal funding, much discussion has been made to upgrade it to interstate standards and eventually incorporate it into the interstate system, most likely as Interstate 9. Major improvements to signage, lane width, median separation, vertical clearance, and other concerns are currently underway.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725fe63ec44d21400f3d7dd"><p> <strong class="question">Which is the largest city not connected to an interstate highway?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Fresno</span><span class="answer">Fresno</span><span class="answer">Fresno</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725fe63ec44d21400f3d7de"><p> <strong class="question">In what year was the Interstate Highway System created?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1950s</span><span class="answer">in the 1950s</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725fe63ec44d21400f3d7df"><p> <strong class="question">Which State Route has been in discussion to upgrade to interstate standards?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">99</span><span class="answer">State Route 99</span><span class="answer">State Route 99</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5725fe63ec44d21400f3d7e0"><p> <strong class="question">What are the factors that are contributing to the desire to have SR 99 improved to be of interstate standards?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along SR 99</span><span class="answer">rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along SR 99, as well as the desirability of Federal funding</span><span class="answer">rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along SR 99, as well as the desirability of Federal funding</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak San Joaquins.
