Its name originated from the Latin word &quot;imperium&quot;, which means to rule over large territories. Imperialism is &quot;a policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means&quot;. Imperialism has greatly shaped the contemporary world. It has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas. The term imperialism has been applied to Western (and Japanese) political and economic dominance especially in Asia and Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars. Some writers, such as Edward Said, use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised with an imperial center and a periphery.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573060b48ab72b1400f9c4c6"><p> <strong class="question">The word imperialism has it's origins in which ancient language? </strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Latin</span><span class="answer">Latin</span><span class="answer">Latin</span><span class="answer">Latin</span><span class="answer">Latin</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573060b48ab72b1400f9c4c7"><p> <strong class="question">By what means is imperialism usually administered?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">military force</span><span class="answer">colonization, use of military force, or other means</span><span class="answer">colonization, use of military force, or other means</span><span class="answer">colonization, use of military force, or other</span><span class="answer">colonization</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573060b48ab72b1400f9c4c9"><p> <strong class="question">The term imperialism has been applied to western countries, and which eastern county?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Japan</span><span class="answer">Japan</span><span class="answer">Japanese</span><span class="answer">Japanese</span><span class="answer">Japan</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573060b48ab72b1400f9c4ca"><p> <strong class="question">Imperialism is responsible for the rapid spread of what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">technologies and ideas</span><span class="answer">technologies and ideas</span><span class="answer">technologies and ideas</span><span class="answer">technologies and ideas</span><span class="answer">technologies and ideas.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Imperialism is defined as &quot;A policy of extending a country’s power and influence through diplomacy or military force.&quot; Imperialism is particularly focused on the control that one group, often a state power, has on another group of people.

Further on, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;informal&quot; imperialism, the first meaning physical control or &quot;full-fledged colonial rule&quot; while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57306797396df919000960ee"><p> <strong class="question">A forced trade agreement between two countries would be an example of what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">&quot;informal&quot; imperialism</span><span class="answer">Informal rule</span><span class="answer">informal&quot; imperialism</span><span class="answer">imperialism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57306797396df919000960ef"><p> <strong class="question">colonial rule, or physical occupation of a territory is an example of what kind of imperialism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">&quot;formal&quot;</span><span class="answer">formal</span><span class="answer">formal</span><span class="answer">formal</span><span class="answer">formal</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57306797396df919000960f0"><p> <strong class="question">Some have generalized the meaning of the word imperialism down to general-purpose what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">aggressiveness</span><span class="answer">aggressiveness</span><span class="answer">aggressiveness</span><span class="answer">aggressiveness</span><span class="answer">aggressiveness</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57306797396df919000960f2"><p> <strong class="question">What subtle tool can be used in an informal imperialistic situation to expand a controlled area?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ownership of private industries</span><span class="answer">technological superiority</span><span class="answer">technological superiority</span><span class="answer">ownership of private industries</span><span class="answer">technological superiority,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57306797396df919000960f1"><p> <strong class="question">Which is more costly, formal, or informal imperialism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">informal</span><span class="answer">Informal rule is generally less costly</span><span class="answer">Informal rule</span><span class="answer">formal</span><span class="answer">formal</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>&quot;The word ‘empire’ comes from the Latin word imperium; for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be ‘sovereignty’, or simply ‘rule’&quot;. The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is &quot;that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea&quot;. Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa &quot;have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires&quot;. European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that &quot;imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism&quot;. This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573081c2069b531400832133"><p> <strong class="question">The amount of land a country controls is its greatest what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">distinction</span><span class="answer">distinction</span><span class="answer">distinction</span><span class="answer">distinction</span><span class="answer">distinction</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573081c2069b531400832134"><p> <strong class="question">Western Imperialism divided the globe according to which theory?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the world systems theory</span><span class="answer">world systems theory</span><span class="answer">world systems theory.</span><span class="answer">world systems theory</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573081c2069b531400832135"><p> <strong class="question">Who suggested that imperialism was the &quot;highest&quot; form of capitalism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Lenin</span><span class="answer">Lenin</span><span class="answer">Lenin</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573081c2069b531400832136"><p> <strong class="question">One country's authority over a number of others would constitute the original country as what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">empires</span><span class="answer">empires</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573081c2069b531400832137"><p> <strong class="question">Most imperialism was carried out using which method of transport?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">seaborne</span><span class="answer">land</span><span class="answer">sea and trade routes</span><span class="answer">sea</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The term &quot;imperialism&quot; is often conflated with &quot;colonialism&quot;, however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition. Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; &quot;imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed]</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6d"><p> <strong class="question">Imperialism is confused with what other term?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">colonialism</span><span class="answer">colonialism</span><span class="answer">colonialism</span><span class="answer">colonialism</span><span class="answer">colonialism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6e"><p> <strong class="question">What does colonialism lack that imperialism has?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">political focus</span><span class="answer">political focus</span><span class="answer">political focus</span><span class="answer">political focus</span><span class="answer">ideological</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6f"><p> <strong class="question">Colonialism as a policy is caused by financial and what other reasons?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">ideological</span><span class="answer">ideological</span><span class="answer">ideological</span><span class="answer">commercial</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573083dc2461fd1900a9ce70"><p> <strong class="question">Who besides the Russians are often left out of the colonialism debat?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Ottoman</span><span class="answer">Ottoman</span><span class="answer">Ottoman</span><span class="answer">Ottoman</span><span class="answer">Ottoman</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573083dc2461fd1900a9ce71"><p> <strong class="question">Imperialism and colonialism both assert a states dominance over what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">person or group of people</span><span class="answer">a person or group of people</span><span class="answer">a person or group of people</span><span class="answer">person or group of people</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two. Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54c"><p> <strong class="question">Political advantage is an attribute of which state policies?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Imperialism and colonialism</span><span class="answer">Imperialism and colonialism</span><span class="answer">Imperialism and colonialism</span><span class="answer">Imperialism and colonialism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54d"><p> <strong class="question">Colonialism often means a country doing what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">taking physical control of another</span><span class="answer">a conquest over an area</span><span class="answer">the process of a country taking physical control of another</span><span class="answer">dominating areas</span><span class="answer">country taking physical control of another</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54e"><p> <strong class="question">How would one create an empire by means of Imperialism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">conquering the other state's lands</span><span class="answer">conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance</span><span class="answer">by conquering the other state's lands</span><span class="answer">political and monetary dominance</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573085ea8ab72b1400f9c550"><p> <strong class="question">What is colonialism's core meaning?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">exploitation</span><span class="answer">the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies</span><span class="answer">the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered</span><span class="answer">exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits</span><span class="answer">exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54f"><p> <strong class="question">what do conquering people pass down to native populations?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">characteristics</span><span class="answer">characteristics of the conquering peoples</span><span class="answer">characteristics of the conquering peoples</span><span class="answer">the characteristics of the conquering peoples</span><span class="answer">characteristics</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>A controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds.

Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed. Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism. The purportedly scientific nature of &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism.

This imaginative geography relies on an essentializing discourse that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality of the East. Rather, by essentializing the East, this discourse uses the idea of place-based identities to create difference and distance between &quot;we&quot; the West and &quot;them&quot; the East, or &quot;here&quot; in the West and &quot;there&quot; in the East. This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West. Defining the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the West’s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled. The discourse of Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism, as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other territories.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57308f6b8ab72b1400f9c580"><p> <strong class="question">Orientalism refers to how the West developed a what of the East?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">an imaginative geography</span><span class="answer">imaginative geography</span><span class="answer">imaginative geography</span><span class="answer">imaginative geography</span><span class="answer">imaginative geography</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57308f6b8ab72b1400f9c581"><p> <strong class="question">Early Western texts referencing the East describe the people as being what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">irrational and backward</span><span class="answer">them</span><span class="answer">as irrational and backward</span><span class="answer">irrational and backward</span><span class="answer">irrational and backward</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57308f6b8ab72b1400f9c582"><p> <strong class="question">The West saw the East as what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">inferior</span><span class="answer">irrational and backward</span><span class="answer">its inferior</span><span class="answer">irrational and backward</span><span class="answer">inferior</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57308f6b8ab72b1400f9c583"><p> <strong class="question">What was used by the West to justify control over eastern territories?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Orientalism</span><span class="answer">inferior</span><span class="answer">Defining the East as a negative vision of itself</span><span class="answer">Orientalism</span><span class="answer">Orientalism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57308f6b8ab72b1400f9c584"><p> <strong class="question">The West saw themselves as what compared to the east?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">progressive</span><span class="answer">rational and progressive</span><span class="answer">rational and progressive</span><span class="answer">rational and progressive</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>To better illustrate this idea, Bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenth-century maps during the &quot;scramble for Africa&quot;.

The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire. Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.'&quot;[attribution needed] Because of the resources made available by imperialism, the world's economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before World War I, making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309564069b5314008321a5"><p> <strong class="question">When was John Gallagher born?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1919</span><span class="answer">1919</span><span class="answer">1919</span><span class="answer">1919</span><span class="answer">1919</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309564069b5314008321a6"><p> <strong class="question">When did Ronald Robinson die?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1999</span><span class="answer">1999</span><span class="answer">1999</span><span class="answer">1999</span><span class="answer">1999</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309564069b5314008321a7"><p> <strong class="question">What profession were Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">historians</span><span class="answer">historians</span><span class="answer">historians</span><span class="answer">historians</span><span class="answer">historians</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309564069b5314008321a8"><p> <strong class="question">What grew on a global scale as a result of imperialism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the world's economy</span><span class="answer">economy</span><span class="answer">economy</span><span class="answer">world's economy</span><span class="answer">world's economy</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309564069b5314008321a9"><p> <strong class="question">Who was made rich and prosperous prior to World War 1</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">many imperial powers</span><span class="answer">imperial powers</span><span class="answer">imperial powers</span><span class="answer">imperial powers</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Europe's expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies, in combination with assuming political control by military and political means.

The term &quot;Imperialism&quot; was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of &quot;imperialism&quot; such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of &quot;imperialism&quot;. Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309bfb8ab72b1400f9c5e6"><p> <strong class="question">Theories on imperialism use which country as a model?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">British</span><span class="answer">British</span><span class="answer">British</span><span class="answer">British</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309bfb8ab72b1400f9c5e7"><p> <strong class="question">When did the term imperialism first come to be used by its current definition?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">in the late 1870s</span><span class="answer">1870s</span><span class="answer">1870s</span><span class="answer">late 1870s</span><span class="answer">1870s</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309bfb8ab72b1400f9c5e8"><p> <strong class="question">What was the idealized value of imperialism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">philanthropy</span><span class="answer">idealism and philanthropy</span><span class="answer">philanthropy</span><span class="answer">idealism and philanthropy</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309bfb8ab72b1400f9c5e9"><p> <strong class="question">According to Lenin why must capitalistic countries have an imperialistic policy?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">to constantly expand investment</span><span class="answer">to constantly expand investment</span><span class="answer">to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower</span><span class="answer">need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower</span><span class="answer">need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The correlation between capitalism, aristocracy, and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists.

While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the interwar years. Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and it's impact on Europe, as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s. Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation. Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309ef18ab72b1400f9c600"><p> <strong class="question">some debate that there is a correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">aristocracy</span><span class="answer">aristocracy</span><span class="answer">aristocracy</span><span class="answer">aristocracy</span><span class="answer">aristocracy</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309ef18ab72b1400f9c602"><p> <strong class="question">When was the military-political complex reflected upon within the scope of understanding imperialism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the 1950s</span><span class="answer">1950s</span><span class="answer">1950s</span><span class="answer">1950s</span><span class="answer">1950s</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309ef18ab72b1400f9c601"><p> <strong class="question">When were Joseph Schumpeter and Norman Angell at their most prolific writing period?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">before World War I</span><span class="answer">World War I</span><span class="answer">before World War I</span><span class="answer">before World War I</span><span class="answer">before World War I,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309ef18ab72b1400f9c603"><p> <strong class="question">Hobson argued that imperialism was an international what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">disease</span><span class="answer">disease</span><span class="answer">disease</span><span class="answer">disease</span><span class="answer">disease</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="57309ef18ab72b1400f9c604"><p> <strong class="question">How did Hobson argue to rid the world of imperialism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">taxation</span><span class="answer">removing its economic foundation</span><span class="answer">domestic social reforms</span><span class="answer">removing its economic foundation</span><span class="answer">removing its economic foundation.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The concept environmental determinism served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples. It was believed that a certain person's behaviours were determined by the environment in which they lived and thus validated their domination. For example, people living in tropical environments were seen as &quot;less civilized&quot; therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission. Across the three waves of European colonialism (first in the Americas, second in Asia and lastly in Africa), environmental determinism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy. This takes two forms, orientalism and tropicality.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730a0778ab72b1400f9c60a"><p> <strong class="question">What served as a justification for imposing imperialistic policies on certain peoples or regions?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">environmental determinism</span><span class="answer">environmental determinism</span><span class="answer">environmental determinism</span><span class="answer">environmental determinism</span><span class="answer">environmental determinism</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730a0778ab72b1400f9c60b"><p> <strong class="question">What was thought to decide a person's behavior?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the environment in which they lived</span><span class="answer">environment in which they lived</span><span class="answer">environment</span><span class="answer">the environment in which they lived</span><span class="answer">environment</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730a0778ab72b1400f9c60c"><p> <strong class="question">Humans in tropical environments were considered what?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">less civilized</span><span class="answer">less civilized</span><span class="answer">less civilized</span><span class="answer">less civilized</span><span class="answer">less civilized</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730a0778ab72b1400f9c60d"><p> <strong class="question">Europe first colonized the Americas, then Asia, but what continent was third?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Africa</span><span class="answer">Africa</span><span class="answer">Africa</span><span class="answer">Africa</span><span class="answer">Africa</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730a0778ab72b1400f9c60e"><p> <strong class="question">What were the two forms of environmental determinism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">orientalism and tropicality</span><span class="answer">orientalism and tropicality</span><span class="answer">orientalism and tropicality</span><span class="answer">orientalism and tropicality</span><span class="answer">orientalism and tropicality.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>According to geographic scholars under colonizing empires, the world could be split into climatic zones.

The participation of Austria was primarily as a result of Habsburg control of the First Empire, the Spanish throne, and other royal houses.[further explanation needed] After the defeat of Napoleon, who caused the dissolution of that Holy Roman Empire, Prussia and the German states continued to stand aloof from imperialism, preferring to manipulate the European system through the Concert of Europe. After Prussia unified the other states into the second German Empire after the Franco-German War, its long-time Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck (1862–90), long opposed colonial acquisitions, arguing that the burden of obtaining, maintaining, and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefits. He felt that colonies did not pay for themselves, that the German bureaucratic system would not work well in the tropics and the diplomatic disputes over colonies would distract Germany from its central interest, Europe itself.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730ac782461fd1900a9cf73"><p> <strong class="question">Germany doesn't have an imperialistic past until when?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">late 19th century</span><span class="answer">late 19th century</span><span class="answer">19th century</span><span class="answer">late 19th century</span><span class="answer">late 19th century.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730ac782461fd1900a9cf74"><p> <strong class="question">When was Otto von Bismarck born?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1862</span><span class="answer">1862</span><span class="answer">1862</span><span class="answer">1862</span><span class="answer">1862</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730ac782461fd1900a9cf75"><p> <strong class="question">When was the the second German empire founded?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">after the Franco-German War</span><span class="answer">after the Franco-German War</span><span class="answer">after the Franco-German War</span><span class="answer">after the Franco-German War</span><span class="answer">after the Franco-German War,</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730ac782461fd1900a9cf77"><p> <strong class="question">Who caused the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Napoleon</span><span class="answer">Napoleon</span><span class="answer">the defeat of Napoleon</span><span class="answer">Napoleon</span><span class="answer">defeat of Napoleon</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730ac782461fd1900a9cf76"><p> <strong class="question">What was Germany's central interest?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Europe</span><span class="answer">Europe</span><span class="answer">Europe</span><span class="answer">Europe</span><span class="answer">Europe itself.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>However, in 1883–84 Germany began to build a colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific, before losing interest in imperialism.

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the &quot;thaw&quot;, in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b4282461fd1900a9cfc5"><p> <strong class="question">Trotsky thought what was needed for a true Russian revolution.</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">a world revolution</span><span class="answer">world revolution</span><span class="answer">a world revolution</span><span class="answer">a world revolution</span><span class="answer">world revolution.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b4282461fd1900a9cfc6"><p> <strong class="question">Who wrote that imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Lenin</span><span class="answer">Lenin</span><span class="answer">Lenin</span><span class="answer">Lenin</span><span class="answer">Lenin</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b4282461fd1900a9cfc9"><p> <strong class="question">Who argued that the USSR had itself become an imperialist power?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Mao Zedong</span><span class="answer">Mao Zedong</span><span class="answer">Mao Zedong</span><span class="answer">Mao Zedong</span><span class="answer">Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b4282461fd1900a9cfc8"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the leader of Russia in the 1960's?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Nikita Khrushchev</span><span class="answer">Nikita Khrushchev</span><span class="answer">Nikita Khrushchev</span><span class="answer">Nikita Khrushchev</span><span class="answer">Khrushchev</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b4282461fd1900a9cfc7"><p> <strong class="question">What policy did Stalin implement shortly after Lenin's Death?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">socialism in one country</span><span class="answer">socialism</span><span class="answer">socialism</span><span class="answer">socialism</span><span class="answer">socialism in one country'</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The First British Empire was based on mercantilism, and involved colonies and holdings primarily in North America, the Caribbean, and India.

However, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century, policies such as Theodore Roosevelt’s interventionism in Central America and Woodrow Wilson’s mission to &quot;make the world safe for democracy&quot; changed all this. They were often backed by military force, but were more often affected from behind the scenes. This is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires. In 1898, Americans who opposed imperialism created the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the US annexation of the Philippines and Cuba. One year later, a war erupted in the Philippines causing business, labor and government leaders in the US to condemn America's occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos. American foreign policy was denounced as a &quot;racket&quot; by Smedley Butler, an American general. He said, &quot;Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts.

Bowman was the director of the American Geographical Society in 1914. Three years later in 1917, he was appointed to then President Woodrow Wilson's inquiry in 1917. The inquiry was the idea of President Wilson and the American delegation from the Paris Peace Conference. The point of this inquiry was to build a premise that would allow for U.S authorship of a 'new world' which was to be characterized by geographical order. As a result of his role in the inquiry, Isiah Bowman would come to be known as Wilson's geographer. </pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b8ca8ab72b1400f9c704"><p> <strong class="question">Who was the director of the American Geographical Society in 1914?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Isiah Bowman</span><span class="answer">Isiah Bowman</span><span class="answer">Isiah Bowman</span><span class="answer">Isiah Bowman</span><span class="answer">Isiah Bowman</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b8ca8ab72b1400f9c705"><p> <strong class="question">When was Isiah Bowman appointed to President Wilson's Inquiry?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">1917</span><span class="answer">1917</span><span class="answer">1917</span><span class="answer">1917</span><span class="answer">1917</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b8ca8ab72b1400f9c706"><p> <strong class="question">Who besides Woodrow Wilson himself had the idea for the inquiry?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">American delegation from the Paris Peace Conference</span><span class="answer">American delegation from the Paris Peace Conference</span><span class="answer">the American delegation from the Paris Peace Conference</span><span class="answer">American delegation from the Paris Peace Conference</span><span class="answer">American delegation from the Paris Peace Conference</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b8ca8ab72b1400f9c707"><p> <strong class="question">What was the premise of Woodrow Wilson's inquiry?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">U.S authorship of a 'new world'</span><span class="answer">allow for U.S authorship of a 'new world' which was to be characterized by geographical order</span><span class="answer">allow for U.S authorship of a 'new world' which was to be characterized by geographical order</span><span class="answer">allow for U.S authorship of a 'new world'</span><span class="answer">U.S authorship of a 'new world'</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730b8ca8ab72b1400f9c708"><p> <strong class="question">What was Isiah Bowman nick name, as known by the public.</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">Wilson's geographer</span><span class="answer">Wilson's geographer</span><span class="answer">Wilson's geographer</span><span class="answer">Wilson's geographer</span><span class="answer">Wilson's geographer.</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>Some have described the internal strife between various people groups as a form of imperialism or colonialism. This internal form is distinct from informal U.S. imperialism in the form of political and financial hegemony. This internal form of imperialism is also distinct from the United States' formation of &quot;colonies&quot; abroad. Through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion, the United States took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism. This internal form of empire has been referred to as &quot;internal colonialism&quot;. Participation in the African slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million Africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of America's &quot;internal colonialism&quot;. However, this internal colonialism faced resistance, as external colonialism did, but the anti-colonial presence was far less prominent due to the nearly complete dominance that the United States was able to assert over both indigenous peoples and African-Americans. In his lecture on April 16, 2003, Edward Said made a bold statement on modern imperialism in the United States, whom he described as using aggressive means of attack towards the contemporary Orient, &quot;due to their backward living, lack of democracy and the violation of women’s rights. The western world forgets during this process of converting the other that enlightenment and democracy are concepts that not all will agree upon&quot;.</pre></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="qas-wrap"><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730bb522461fd1900a9d011"><p> <strong class="question">Some people describe what between individuals or groups as imperialism or colonialism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">internal strife</span><span class="answer">internal strife</span><span class="answer">internal strife</span><span class="answer">internal strife</span><span class="answer">internal strife</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730bb522461fd1900a9d012"><p> <strong class="question">the US expansion Westward could be viewed as what type of colonialism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">&quot;internal colonialism&quot;</span><span class="answer">internal colonialism</span><span class="answer">internal colonialism</span><span class="answer">internal colonialism</span><span class="answer">internal</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730bb522461fd1900a9d013"><p> <strong class="question">How many Africans were brought into the United States during the slave trade?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">12 to 15 million</span><span class="answer">12 to 15 million</span><span class="answer">12 to 15 million</span><span class="answer">12 to 15 million</span><span class="answer">12 to 15 million</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div><div class="qa-wrap" data-id="5730bb522461fd1900a9d015"><p> <strong class="question">Who does Edward Said say is being attacked by US imperialism?</strong></p><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><p><i>Ground Truth Answers: </i><span class="answer">the contemporary Orient</span><span class="answer">the contemporary Orient</span><span class="answer">the contemporary Orient</span><span class="answer">contemporary Orient</span><span class="answer">contemporary Orient, &quot;</span></p></li><li class="prediction-holder"><p><i>Prediction: </i><span class="prediction"></span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><pre>The Ottoman Empire was an imperial state that lasted from 1299 to 1923.
